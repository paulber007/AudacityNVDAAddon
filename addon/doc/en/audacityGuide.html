	<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
	
	<p>Warning: this is a guide to Audacity 2.2.0 which has not yet been released.
	In addition, this guide is still a work in progress.</p>

	<p>This is a guide for the 2.2.0 version of Audacity, which is a free
	multi-track audio editor. You can use it for recording, simple editing
	of single tracks, or more advanced editing involving multiple tracks.</p>
	
	<p>Audacity 2.2.0 can be downloaded from the
	<a href="http://audacityteam.org/">home page of Audacity's website</a>.</p>
	
	<p>The remaining sections of the introduction are as follows. There are introductions
	to Projects and the cursor in Audacity, and descriptions of the welcome message
	box, and how to get help. There is then an outline of some new features and
	changes in this version of Audacity which are relevant to users of screen readers.
	Some of these changes are very significant. There
	are then sections on Audacity's two sets of default shortcuts, some advice
	if you are using a non US/UK keyboard, and details of where to get the
	Jaws script for Audacity.</p>

		
	<h3>Projects</h3>
	
	<p>The objects which Audacity edits are known as projects. So projects
	are equivalent to documents in Microsoft Word, and workbooks in
	Microsoft Excel.</p>
	
	<p>An Audacity project simply consists of a number of tracks, and there
	are a number of different types of track in Audacity: audio, label,
	and time. However, time track are not accessible to users of screen readers,
	and so won't be described in this guide.
	For many simple tasks you'll probably only have one track in a project.</p>
	
	<p>You can save an Audacity project using the Audacity project
	file format, and this preserves all the tracks in the project.
	However, you only need to save a project in this format if you
	intend to continue working on the project in the future.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Cursor</h3>
	
	<p>Audacity has a cursor to specify a particular time during the
	audio, and this is similar to the cursor in Microsoft Word. The
	cursor in Audacity is used for defining times such as: the start
	of playback, the position where you want to start selecting a time range,
	and the place where audio is pasted from the clipboard.</p>
	
		
	<h3>Welcome message box</h3>
	
	<p>When you open Audacity, a Welcome message box opens, and this
	contains an HTML window which contains some information on how to
	obtain help for Audacity. Unfortunately the links in this text
	can't be opened using keyboard navigation, but details of the
	available help are given in the next section. The message box
	also contains a &ldquo;Don't show this again at start up&rdquo; check box.
	To stop the message box appearing in future, just check the check box,
	and press the OK button.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Help</h3>
	
	<p>Audacity is an extremely powerful program, and this is only
	an introductory guide. For more information see:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Audacity_Wiki_Home_Page">The Audacity Wiki</a>.</li>
		
		<li>The installed Audacity user manual which can be opened in your
		default browser by choosing Manual on the Help menu.</li>
		
		<li>The <a href="http://www.freelists.org/list/audacity4blind">Audacity4Blind mailing list</a>.
		On this web page you can subscribe to the mailing list: type your
		email address into to the &ldquo;your email address&rdquo; edit box,
		<strong>Tab</strong> to the Go button and press it. You will receive
		an email to confirm the subscription. Simply reply to this email without
		adding any additional text.</li>	
	</ul>
	
	
	<h3>New features and changes</h3>
	
	<p>The new features and changes in this version of Audacity which are relevant
	to users of screen readers include:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Clips are now accessible for users of screen readers. There are new commands
		for moving the cursor to clip boundaries, selecting clips, and moving clips.
		These are described in the <a href="#clips">Clip section</a>, along with
		various existing commands which involve clips.</li>
		
		<li>When recording, appending the recorded audio to an existing track is now the default,
		rather than inserting the audio in a new track. So pressing <strong>R</strong> adds
		the audio to an existing track, and pressing <strong>Shift + R</strong> inserts the
		audio in a new track. However, there is an option to have recording in a new track
		as the default, as it was in previous versions of Audacity. For more details, see the
		<a href="recording-controls">Recording controls section</a>.</li>
		
		<li>More options for the selection details shown in the
		<a href="#selection-bar">Selection bar</a>. In addition
		to the previous options of start and then either length or end, there are
		now options for end and length, and centre and length.</li>
		
		<li>There is now a choice of two sets of default shortcuts, standard and full,
		as described in the next section.</li>
		
		<li>The menus have been reorganized. The changes include a new Select menu,
		and two <a href="#extra-menus">Extra menus</a>, which contain commands which were previously
		not included in the menus.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h3>Default shortcuts</h3>
	
	<p>If you run Audacity 2.2.0 in an account in which previous versions of the program have not
	been run, then by default, there are less shortcuts available than in previous versions
	of the program. However, you can change to using a fuller set of shortcuts, and this
	is described in the
	<a href="#standard-and-full">Standard and full sets of default shortcuts section</a>
	of the Preferences section. The remainder of this guide assumes you are using
	the full set.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Using keyboards other than US, UK, or Irish</h3>
	
	<p>If you're using a keyboard other than a US, UK, or Irish keyboard, then a couple
	of important keystrokes won't work if you're using Audacity's default settings.
	To fix this, see the
	<a href="#the-and-shortcuts">The [ and ] shortcuts on keyboards other than US, UK or Irish section</a>
	which is in the Customizing section.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Jaws Script</h3>
	
	<p>There's a Jaws script for Audacity, and its uses include giving additional feedback, and providing
	convenient ways of obtaining information. Full details of its functionality can be found on the
	<a href="https://github.com/campg2j003/JAWS-Script-for-Audacity">Jaws Script for Audacity website</a>.
	A direct link to to the installer for version 2.1.0 of this script is:
	<a href="https://github.com/campg2j003/JAWS-Script-for-Audacity/releases/download/rel2.1.0/Jaws-Script-for-Audacity_2_1_0.exe">Jaws-Script-for-Audacity_2_1_0.exe</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Note that the remainder of the guide does not assume that this script is installed.</p>
	
	
	
	<h2 id="main-window">Main window</h2>
	
	<h3>Main components</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Title bar. When the window contains an unnamed project,
		for example, when you first start Audacity, then the text in the title bar
		is Audacity. When the window contains a named project,
		then the text is the name of the project. To read the
		title bar press <strong>Insert + T</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>Menu bar. There are two <a href="#extra-menus">extra menus</a>extra
		which can be shown in the menu bar, but which are not shown by default.</li>
		
		<li><a href="#toolbars">Toolbars</a>.</li>
		
		<li><a href="#track-table">Track table</a>.
		This contains the tracks which make up the project.</li>
		
		<li><a href="#selection-bar">Selection bar</a>.
		This contains controls for reading and setting the cursor position
		and the start and end/length of any selected time range.</li>
		
		<li>Status bar, which is divided into 3 sections. The first section
		is probably of the most interest, and contains the transport status,
		that is, whether Audacity is stopped, playing, recording and so on.
		To read the status bar, press <strong>Insert + Page Down</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h3>Moving around the window</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>As in any window, to move to the menu bar press <strong>Alt</strong>,
		and to leave it press <strong>Esc</strong> of <strong>Alt</strong>.</li>

		<li>Pressing <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong> moves you around the following
		components: Toolbars, Track table, Selection bar, Toolbars, etc.
		Pressing <strong>Ctrl + Shift + F6</strong> moves you around in the
		opposite direction.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h2 id="opening-audio-file">Opening an audio file</h2>
	
	<p>To open either an audacity project file or a standard audio file,
	use the Open dialog, which is on the File menu (<strong>Ctrl + O</strong>).
	The dialog's title is &ldquo;Select one or more audio files...&rdquo;,
	and its structure is similar to the standard Windows XP Open dialog.
	The types of standard audio files which Audacity can open described
	in the next section.</p>
	
	<p>When you first open Audacity, the window contains an empty
	track table, and so when you open an audio file, it opens in
	this initial window. After opening a standard audio file,
	the track table contains a single track, whereas after opening an Audacity
	project file, the track table contains all the tracks in the saved project.
	If you then open any other audio files, then they
	each open in a new window. (If you want to deliberately create
	a new window with an empty project, choose New from the File menu,
	or press <strong>Ctrl + N</strong>.)</p>
	
	<p>In addition to opening standard audio files, you can also import one or
	more standard audio files into the current project. In this case, a new
	track is added to the track table for each of the files. For details,
	see the <a href="#importing-audio-files">Importing audio files section</a>.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Opening standard audio files</h3>
	
    <p>The default installation of Audacity can open audio files in the following standard
    formats: WAV, AIFF, AU, MP3, MP2/MPEG, Ogg Vorbis, and FLAC.
	In addition, you can open files in some other formats, including
	wma and m4a if you download and install the FFmpeg library,
	as described in the
	<a href="#ffmpeg-library">FFmpeg library section</a>. This is not included in the
	installation of Audacity due to legal issues about patents.</p>
	
	<p>An alternative to using the FFmpeg library for opening files
	in other formats is to use another
    program to convert the file to one of the formats the default installation of Audacity
    can open. There are several audio format conversion programs
    available, for example, <a href="http://www.nch.com.au/switch/">Switch</a>
    which is free in its basic version, or 
	<a href="http://www.dbpoweramp.com/dmc.htm">dBpoweramp Music Converter</a>.</p>
   
    <p>If you open a compressed file, such as an MP3 file, then
    after you press the open button in the Open dialog an Import
    dialog opens which gives the progress of Audacity decompressing
    the file.</p>

	
	<h2 id="saving-audio">Saving audio</h2>
	
	<p>You can save the audio in a project in either the audacity project
	format, or one of the standard audio formats, as described in the following sections.
	The Audacity project format preserves all the tracks in the project.
	You only need to save a project in the audacity project format
	if you intend to continue working on the project in the future.
	In contrast, when you save in one of the standard audio formats,
	Audacity automatically mixes all the tracks down to a single track.</p>
	
	<p>When you close Audacity, if you haven't saved your changes to
	an Audacity project file, then a Save changes? dialog opens asking
	you whether you want to save changes before closing. The default
	button is Yes, but unless you want to save the project as an
	Audacity project file, just <strong>Tab</strong> to the NO button
	and press it.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Saving audio in the audacity project format</h3>
	
	<p>To save in this format, choose Save Project... from the File menu. The first
	time you do this, you get a Warning dialog box telling you that
	only Audacity can read these project files. The dialog box contains
	a check box which you can check if you don't want this warning again.
	If you press the OK button, you then get a Save Project As dialog.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Saving audio in one of the standard audio formats</h3>
	
	<p>The default installation of Audacity can save in the following
	standard formats: WAV, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, and MP2. In addition,
	you can save in some other formats if you download and install some
	additional libraries which are not included with Audacity because
	of legal issues with patents:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>You can save in the MP3 format if you download and install
		the LAME MP3 library, as described in the
		<a href="#lame-mp3-encoder-library">LAME MP3 encoder library section</a>.</li>
		
		<li>You can save in formats including wma and m4a if you download
		and install the FFmpeg library, and described in the
		<a href="#ffmpeg-library">FFmpeg library section</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<p>To save audio in one of the standard audio formats:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>To save all the audio, open the File menu, open the Save Other
		sub menu, and choose Export Audio (<strong>Ctrl + Shift + E</strong>).
		Alternatively, so save only the selected audio, choose Export Selected
		Audio from the same sub menu.</li>	
		
		<li>The Export Audio dialog opens, and its structure is very
		similar to a standard Windows XP Save As dialog.</li>
		
		<li>To set the file format which you want to use for saving
		the audio, there's a Save as type combo box, which is the next
		control after the File name edit box, which is the initial focus.
		Note that all the formats which use the FFmpeg library, have
		FFmpeg in parenthesis after their name.</li>
		
		<li>After choosing the file format, you can set the options for
		the encoding used by that format by tabbing to the controls which
		appear after the Cancel button. Since
		the MP3 format is often used, the numerous options for MP3 encoding are
		described in the following section.</li>
		
		<li>The Metadata tags editor dialog opens. This enables you to edit
		various items of information about the audio data, such as the
		Artist name, and the Track title, and is described in detail in the
		<a href="#metadata-tags-editor">Metadata tags editor section</a> later in the guide.
		If you don't want to edit any of the information, then you
		can just press <strong>Enter</strong> to press the default OK button.
		Note that if you cancel the dialog,
		as well as cancelling any edits in this dialog, this also cancels the saving
		of the audio. If you don't want the Metadata editor to automatically
		open each time you save audio, then you can turn this option
		off, as described in the
		<a href="#metadata-tags-editor-opens-during-export">Metadata tags editor opens during export section</a>,
		which is in the Preferences section.</li>
		
		<li>Note that if you've tried to save in
		the MP3 format, but haven't installed the Lame MP3 library, then
		a Locate Lame dialog opens. Similarly, if you've tried to save
		in any of the formats included in the FFmpeg library, then a message
		box opens telling you that it needs to be configured.</li>			
	</ol>
	
	<p>The Save Other sub menu on the File menu also contains commands for opening dialogs for
	Exporting as MP3, Wav, and OGG. These commands open the Export Audio dialog with the
	Save as type combo box already set to the appropriate format. However, given that the Export
	Audio dialog remembers the last format that was used, and that the more specific commands
	do not have default shortcuts, you may find is more convenient just to use the Export Audio
	dialog.</p>

	
	<h4>MP3 options</h4>
	
	<p>This section describes the controls for specifying the MP3
	options when exporting in that format, and gives some recommendations for setting them.
	These controls appear after the Cancel button in both the
	Export Audio and the Export Selected audio dialogs, if the
	Save as Type combo box is set to MP3, and also in the
	Export as MP3 dialog.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Bit Rate Mode, a set of 4 radio buttons:
		Preset, Variable, Average, and Constant.</li>
		
		<li>Quality combo box.</li>
		
		<li>Variable Speed combo box, which only appears for some
		of the bit rate modes.</li>
		
		<li>Channel mode, a set of two radio buttons: Joint Stereo,
		and Stereo. This does not appear if the bit rate mode is set
		to Preset.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>These are some recommended settings:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>For music:
			<ul>
				<li>Set the Bit Rate Mode to Variable</li>
				<li>the Quality to either 6, 5, or 4 (the lower the number
				the higher the quality).</li>
				<li>Variable Speed to Fast</li>
				<li>Channel Mode to Joint Stereo.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		
		<li>For speech, or when there's a requirement for small file
		sizes:
			<ul>
				<li>Set the Bit Rate Mode to Average</li>
				<li>The Quality to 64, 80 or 96 kbps (the higher the number
				the higher the quality).</li>
				<li>Channel Mode to Joint Stereo.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>For a full description of the options for the LAME MP3 encoder see the
	<a href="http://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=LAME">Lame page of the Hydrogen Audio wiki</a>.</p>
	
	
	<h2 id="playback">Playback</h2>
	
	<p>Playback depends on whether there is a time range selected
	(see the <a href="#selecting-audio">Selecting audio section</a>):
	if there is no selection, then playback starts at the cursor position;
	if there is a selection, then playback starts at the start of the selection,
	and stops at the end of the selection.</p>
	
	<p>The volume of the playback is controlled by the playback
	slider which is on the Mixer toolbar in the Toolbars.</p>
	
	<p>Keystrokes for playback:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>To start or stop, press <strong>Spacebar</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>To start or stop and move the cursor, press <strong>X</strong>.
		When you use this keystroke to stop playback, the cursor is moved to
		position where the playback was stopped.</li>
	
		<li>Pause or resume, press <strong>P</strong>.</li>
	
		<li>Seeking/Jumping. Whilst playing, if the focus is in the Track
		table, you can jump forward or backward
		by either a short or long period. To jump backward or forward by
		a short period press <strong>Left Arrow</strong> or
		<strong>Right Arrow</strong> respectively. To jump backward or forward
		by a long period, press <strong>Shift + Left Arrow</strong> or
		<strong>Shift + Right Arrow</strong> respectively. The size of both
		the short and long periods can be set in the Preferences dialog,
		as described in the <a href="#seek-times">Seek times section</a>.</li>
		
		<li>To play looped, that is to continuously repeat, press
		<strong>Shift + Spacebar</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The playback status, is the first item in the status bar, which you can read by
	pressing <strong>Insert + Page Down</strong></p>
	
	
	<h2 id="toolbars">Toolbars</h2>
	
	<p>The Toolbars section contains several different toolbars. You
	can navigate to all the controls in the Toolbars just by using the
	<strong>Tab</strong> key. You can press any of the buttons in the toolbars
	by pressing <strong>Enter</strong>.
	However, you can't use <strong>Spacebar</strong> as this key is used for
	starting and stopping playback. The toolbars section also contains an unpinned recording/playback
	button, which sets how the waveform scrolls during recording and playback,
	and so isn't of much interest to most screen reader users.</p>
	
	<p>These are the toolbars which are shown by default:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Transport. This contains buttons for playback and recording,
		and all the commands are also available on the Transport
		menu, and have keyboard shortcuts.</li>
		
		<li>Tools. This contains tool buttons for editing which involve the
		use of the mouse.</li>
		
		<li>Recording meter and Playback meter. Each of these contains a drop down
		button which opens a menu for controlling the meter.</li>
		
		<li>Mixer. This contains the recording and playback volume sliders.</li>
		
		<li>Edit. This contains buttons for Cut, Paste, etc. These
		commands are also available on either the Edit or View menu,
		and all have keyboard shortcuts.</li>
		
		<li>Transcription. This contains a play at selected speed button and a playback
		speed slider.</li>
		
		<li>Device. This contains combo boxes for Audio host, the
		recording device, the number of recording channels, and the playback device. Note that
		if one of these combo boxes is the focus, and you press a character key which
		is an Audacity shortcut, then the key is used for the shortcut, rather
		than selecting an option beginning with that character. So selecting
		an option using its first character is not recommended. In addition,
		if you start playback or recording, then the focus is then automatically
		moved to the Track table.
		
		<p>All these
		settings can also be made either in individual dialogs, or in the Devices
		category of the						
		<a href="#preferences">Preferences dialog</a>. The keystrokes for the
		individual dialogs are <strong>Shift + H</strong> for audio host,
		<strong>Shift + I</strong> for recording device, <strong>Shift + N</strong>
		for number of recording channels, and <strong>Shift + O</strong> for playback
		device.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>You can show and hide all these toolbars using the Toolbars sub-menu
	on the View Menu. Only showing the toolbars you're likely
	to use, such as the Mixer Toolbar, has the advantage of greatly reducing
	the number of <strong>Tab</strong>s needed to find a particular control.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Bug warning</strong>: if you show a toolbar which was not being shown
	when you opened Audacity, the toolbar will be shown as a floating toolbar
	somewhere in the Audacity window, and you will not be able to tab to it.
	To work around this, choose reset toolbars on the Toolbars sub menu.
	You can then set which toolbars are displayed.</p>


	<h2 id="track-table">Track table</h2>
	
	<p>The Track table contains the tracks which make up the project.
	The table just has one column, and a row for each of the tracks.
	Each track has a name, and Jaws reads this when you move to the
	track, or press <strong>Insert + Up Arrow</strong> to read the
	current line.</p>
	
	<p>An audio track is a container for audio data, and this is
	displayed as a waveform. Often the audio data starts at time zero,
	but after editing, this is not always the case. At the left hand end
	of an audio track there is a small area containing various controls,
	which include a menu, and controls
	for track gain and pan. Using these controls is described in the
	<a href="#more-advanced-editing">More advanced editing section</a> of this guide.</p>
	
	<p>The Cursor is displayed in the track table as a vertical line,
	as is the playback position during playback. The positions of
	both the cursor and the playback position are available to Jaws users
	via the Selection Start and Audio Position spin boxes in the
	<a href="#selection-bar">Selection Bar</a>.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Track focus</h3>
	
	<p>Whenever the focus is within the track table, and the table
	contains one or more tracks (rows), then one of the tracks has
	the focus, and you can move to the next or previous track by pressing
	<strong>Down Arrow</strong> or <strong>Up Arrow</strong>, respectively.
	You can also move to the first or last track by pressing
	<strong>Ctrl + Home</strong> or <strong>Ctrl + End</strong>, respectively.</p>
	
	
	<h3 id="track-selection">Track selection</h3>
	
	<p>You need to be able to select tracks:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>For operations such as aligning tracks which can be found
		on the Tracks menu.</li>
		
		<li>As part of the process of selecting some audio, as described
		in the <a href="#selecting-audio">Selecting audio section</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>There are a number of ways of selecting and deselecting tracks:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>To toggle the selection of the focused track, press
		<strong>Enter</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>To select all the tracks (and a time range which includes all the
		audio, as described in the
		<a href="#selecting-audio">Selecting audio section</a>), open the
		Edit menu, open the Select sub menu and choose All (<strong>Ctrl + A</strong>)</li>
		
		<li>To deselect all the tracks (and any time-range), open
		the Edit menu, open the Select sub menu and choose None (<strong>Ctrl + Shift + A</strong>).</li>
		
		<li>To select all the tracks, open the Edit menu, open the Select sub menu,
		and choose In all tracks (<strong>Ctrl + Shift + K</strong>).</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Jaws tells you whether a track is selected, if you do any of the following:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Move the focus to the track.</li>
		
		<li>Press <strong>Insert + Up Arrow</strong> to read the current line.</li>
		
		<li>Toggle the selection of the track, by pressing <strong>Enter</strong>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>More precisely, if you do any of the above, then:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>If the track is not selected, then Jaws says
		table &ldquo;the name of the track&rdquo; row</li>

		<li>If the track is selected, then Jaws says
		table &ldquo;the name of the track&rdquo; select on row.</li>
	</ul>
		

	
	<h2 id="selection-bar">Selection bar</h2>

	<p>There are six controls on the Selection bar, and you can cycle forwards
	or backwards around these controls using <strong>Tab</strong> or
	<strong>Shift + Tab</strong> respectively.</p>

	<ul>	
		<li>Project Rate edit-combo box. This is the sampling rate of the project.</li>
		
		<li>Snap To combo box, which is described below.</li>
		
		<li>Audio Position edit spin box. This gives the position of playback
		or recording.</li>
		
		<li>An unnamed combo box which determines which details of any selected time
		range are shown in the two edit spin boxes, which are the next two controls
		in the toolbar.
		The options for the details which are shown are: start and end, start and length,
		length and end, and length and center. Although this combo box has no name,
		in this guide it will be referred to as the selection details combo box.</li>
		
		<li>Two edit spin boxes, which give the details of the selected time range,
		which have been specified by the preceding combo box.
		If there is no time range selected, then the start, end, or center edit spin
		boxes give the position of the cursor.</li>	
	</ul>		

	
	<h3 id="edit-spin-boxes">Edit spin boxes</h3>

	<p>Each of the spin boxes contains a time which can be in a number of different
	formats. You can change the format by choosing on the options on a
	spin box's context menu, and this changes the format of all the spin boxes.
	The default format is hh:mm:ss, but the format hh:mm:ss + hundredths is
	normally more useful, as it allows you to change the time by smaller amounts.
	Nearly all the examples in this guide will use this format.</p>
	
	<p>The time can be considered to be made up of one or more
	sections, depending on the format used. For example, when using
	the hh:mm:ss format, the time consists of three sections each
	consisting of two digits: hours, minutes, and seconds. Alternatively,
	when using the hh:mm:ss + hundredths format, the time
	consists of four sections: hours, minutes, seconds, and centi-seconds (hundredths
	of seconds), again each consisting of two digits.</p>

	<p>If you move to a spin box by tabbing, then Jaws reads the entire
	contents of the spin box, for example, 00h13m04.73s, that is 0 hours, 13 minutes, and
	4.73 seconds.</p>

	<p>Within a spin box, one of the digits is the focus. When you first
	move to a spin box after opening Audacity, the first digit is the
	focus, but if you subsequently return to the spin box, then the digit
	which was the focus when you left the spin box is the focus.
	The keystrokes for moving the focus are:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Home</strong> or <strong>End</strong> move you to
		the first or last digit in the spin box respectively.</li>

		<li><strong>Left Arrow</strong> or <strong>Right Arrow</strong>
		cycle you through the digits to the left or right respectively.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>When you use one of these keystrokes, Jaw reads the digit which
	is now the focus. In addition, if you've moved to a different
	section of the time, then Jaws reads the new section before reading
	the digit. For example, if the time is 01h42m38.46s and the focus
	is the second of the minutes digits (the digit 2), then if you press
	<strong>Right arrow</strong> Jaws says 38s, 3. Alternatively, if you
	press <strong>End</strong> then Jaws says 46 centi-seconds, 6.</p>

	<p>There are a couple of ways of changing the value of the time:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Increasing or decreasing the value of the control by one unit
		of the focussed digit using
		<strong>Up Arrow</strong> or <strong>Down Arrow</strong>. This is a
		way is useful for increasing or decreasing the value by a given amount of
		time. After each of these keystrokes, Jaws reads the value of the current
		section. For example, if you want to
		increase the time by 3 tenths of a second, and
		assuming that the format is set to hh:mm:ss + hundredths: press <strong>End</strong>
		to move to the last digit, press <strong>Left arrow</strong>
		to move to the tenths of a second digit, and press <strong>Up Arrow</strong>
		three times.</li>
		
		<li>Type in digits. This way is useful for setting a time which not
		connected to the current value. If you type a digit (0 to 9), then the value of the
		focussed digit is replaced by this, and the next digit becomes the focus.
		If the last digit is the initial focus, then after you type a digit,
		then the first digit is the focus. After typing a digit, Jaws reads the
		section containing the focussed digit. For example, if you want to set a control
		to 32 minutes, and again assuming the control has the hh:mm::ss + hundredths
		format: press <strong>Home</strong> to move to the first
		digit, and then type the following 8 digits: 0,0,3,2,0,0,0,0. This
		completely replaces the existing time with the time of 32 minutes.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>To read the entire time, press <strong>Insert + Up Arrow</strong>.</p>
	
	
	
	<h3 id="snap-to-combo-box">Snap To combo box</h3>
	
	<p>The Snap to combo box contains three options: Off, which is the default, Nearest,
	and Prior. If the combo box is set to either Nearest and Prior, then this has two effects on
	using the left and right arrow keys to move the cursor or the start or end of a selected time range.</p>
	
	<p>The first effect is that if Snap combo box to is set to Nearest, then you move the cursor
	or the start or end of a selected time range, then its position is always automatically adjusted to the
	nearest whole number of the smallest unit in the format of the edit spin boxes. For example,
	if format is hh:mm:ss, then a position of 1.3 seconds would be adjusted to 1 second,
	and a time of 1.8 seconds would be adjusted to 2 seconds. In a similar manner,
	if the Snap to combo box is set to Prior, then the times 1.3 seconds and 1.8 seconds
	would both be adjusted to 1 second.</p>
	
	<p>If the Snap to combo box is set to Nearest or Prior, the second effect is that
	the minimum amount that the position of the cursor or the selection start or end
	changes by is the smallest unit in the format of the edit spin boxes. So, for
	example, if the format is set to hh:mm:ss, and you press <strong>Right arrow</strong>
	to move the cursor to the right, the minimum change in position is 1 second.</p>

	
	<h2 id="moving-the-cursor">Moving the cursor</h2>
	
	<p>Audacity has a cursor to specify a particular time during the
	audio, for example, the start of playback, the position where you
	want to start selecting a time range,
	or the position where audio is pasted from the clipboard.</p>
	
	<p>Reading the current position of the cursor is described in the next section,
	and the ways of moving the cursor are as follows:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>To move the cursor to the start of the tracks (time zero),
		press <strong>Home</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>To move the cursor to the end of all the audio, press <strong>End</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>To move the cursor to the start or end of the audio in
		the selected tracks press <strong>J</strong> or <strong>K</strong>
		respectively.</li>		
		
		<li>You can move backward or forward by either a short or long period,
		as long as the focus is in the Track table. To move backward or
		forward by a short period, press <strong>Comma</strong> or
		<strong>Period</strong> respectively. To move backward or forward
		by a long period, press <strong>Shift + Comma</strong> or
		<strong>Shift + Period</strong> respectively. These short and
		long periods share the same values as the short and long periods
		used for seeking/jumping during playback, which was described
		in the <a href="#playback">Playback section</a>. The size of
		both the short and long periods can be set in the Preferences
		dialog, as described in the <a href="#seek-times">Seek times section</a>.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Left Arrow</strong> and <strong>Right Arrow</strong> keys.
		If the focus is in the Track table, then pressing
		<strong>Left Arrow</strong> or <strong>Right Arrow</strong> moves
		the cursor to the left or right by a small amount respectively.
		Adjusting the step size is described in the
		<a href="#step-size">Step size of the left an right arrow keys</a> section
		below.</li>			
		
		<li>The <strong>[</strong> key during playback. If during playback
		you press <strong>[</strong> and then <strong>Spacebar</strong> to stop,
		the cursor is moved to the point in the audio where you pressed
		the <strong>[</strong> key. In practice, the following method is
		more flexible:
		<ol>
			<li>During playback, press <strong>P</strong> to pause when you reach the position
			where you want to move to cursor to.</li>
			<li>If you're unhappy with this position, pres <strong>P</strong> to resume and using
			the Seeking/Jumping keys have another attempt to pause in the
			right place.</li>
			<li>Press <strong>[</strong> to mark the new cursor position.</li>
			<li>Press <strong>Spacebar</strong> to stop.</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		
		<li>Pressing <strong>X</strong> stops playback, and moves the cursor
		to the position where the playback stopped. You can also use this keystroke
		to start playback.</li>
				
		<li>The Selection Start spin box on the
		<a href="#selection-bar">Selection bar</a>. This is described in detail
		in the
		<a href="#moving-the-cursor-with-the-selection-start-control">Moving the cursor with the selection start control</a> section below.</li>
	</ul>

	
	<h3>Reading the position of the cursor</h3>
	
	<p>There are a couple of ways of reading the cursor position. The first
	is to read the Selection start control on the Selection bar:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Assuming that the Track table is the focus, press <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong>
		to move to the Selection bar.</li>
		
		<li>If necessary, <strong>Tab</strong> until you get to the start control,
		which contains the cursor position, and which Jaws reads out. Note
		that when returning to the Selection bar, the control that was previously
		the focus is the focus again, so you often don't have to <strong>Tab</strong>
		to the Selection start control.</li>
		
		<li>Press <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong> twice or <strong>Ctrl + Shift + F6</strong>
		to return to the Track table.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>The second way of reading the cursor position is to open the Set left
	selection boundary dialog:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Whilst there is no playback, press the <strong>[</strong> key to open the Set left selection
		boundary dialog.</li>
		
		<li>The position control is the initial focus, and its value is
		the cursor position. Press <strong>Esc</strong> to close the dialog.</li>
	</ol>	
	
	
	<h3 id="moving-the-cursor-with-the-selection-start-control">Moving the cursor using the selection start control</h3>
	
   <ol>
       <li>Press <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong> to move to the Selection bar.</li>
      
       <li><strong>Tab</strong> to the Selection details combo box, and make
       sure that the Start and length of selection option is selected. If it's set to
	   Start and end of selection, then you can accidentally select a time range,
	   instead of moving the cursor, as described below.</li>
      
       <li><strong>Tab</strong> to the start control, and change its
	   value, as described below.</li>
      
       <li>To return to the Track table, press <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong>
       twice.</li>
   </ol>
	
	<p>As described in the
	<a href="#edit-spin-boxes">Edit spin boxes section</a>, there are a couple a ways of changing
	the values of the controls like the start control:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Incrementing or decrementing the value of the control by one unit
		of the focussed digit using
		<strong>Up Arrow</strong> or <strong>Down Arrow</strong>. For example,
		to move the cursor forward by 2 minutes,
		assuming that the format is set to hh:mm:ss + hundredths: press <strong>End</strong>
		to move to the last digit, which is hundredths of seconds, then press
		<strong>Left Arrow</strong> 4 times to move to the minutes digit,
		and then press <strong>Up Arrow</strong> 2 times.</li>
		
		<li>Typing in digits. For example, to move the cursor to the time 45 minutes,
		again assuming the format is set to hh:mm:ss + hundredths,
		press <strong>Home</strong> to move to the first digit, and then type
		the following 8 digits: 0,0,4,5,0,0,0,0.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h4>Reason for setting the length option</h4>
	
	<p>With no time range selected, consider the two cases:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Selection details combo box set to Start and length of selection. The start control
		displays the cursor position, and the length control displays
		zero. If you change value of the start control, then the
		length control always remains unchanged at zero.</li>
		
		<li>Selection details combo box set to Start and end of selection. The start and
		end controls both display the same value, which is the cursor position.
		If you increase the value of the start control, then the
		value of the end control is automatically increased to the same
		value. However, if you decrease the value of the start control,
		then the end control remains unchanged. So you've accidentally
		selected a time range.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h3 id="step-size">Step size of the left and right arrow keys</h3>
	
	<p>This section describes how the step size of the left and right
	arrow keys depend on the horizontal zoom of the audio data, and how
	to set the amount of zoom so that the step size has suitable values. The same step sizes
	are also used by the <strong>Shift + Left or Right Arrow</strong> and
	<strong>Ctrl + Shift + Left or Right Arrow</strong> keystrokes for
	expanding or contracting selected time ranges.</p>
	
	<p>Audacity has the ability to vary the amount by which the audio data is zoomed in the
	horizontal direction. This allows sighted users to view the audio data in
	either more or less detail, depending on the task.</p>
	
	<p>Pressing <strong>Right Arrow</strong> or <strong>Left Arrow</strong>
	moves the cursor by the same physical distance on the screen, whatever the
	amount of horizontal zoom. So if the amount of zoom is increased, then
	the time by which the cursor is moved is decreased. Similarly, if the
	amount of zoom is decreased, then the time by which the cursor is moved
	is increased.</p>
	
	<p>After opening or importing a file, the horizontal zoom is adjusted
	so that the longest track in the project takes up the available space in
	the track in the window. So the initial amount of zoom, and so the step
	size of the arrow keys depends on the length of the tracks.</p>
	
	<p>However, you can set the horizontal zoom to a predefined amount. You
	can do this by opening the view menu, opening the zoom sub menu,
	and choosing Zoom Normal (<strong>Ctrl + 2</strong>).
	When the zoom is set to normal, then the left and right arrow keys move
	the cursor by slightly more than one hundredth of a second. This step
	size is normally too small to be useful. However, you can easily
	adjust the step size using the zoom in and zoom out commands which
	are also available on the Zoom sub menu on the View menu:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Zoom In (<strong>Ctrl + 1</strong>). This doubles the zoom, and
		so halves the step size of the left and right arrow keys.</li>
		
		<li>Zoom Out (<strong>Ctrl + 3</strong>). This halves the zoom,
		and so doubles the step size of the left and right arrow keys.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>So, for example, after setting the zoom to normal (<strong>Ctrl + 2</strong>),
	which sets the step size to slightly more than one hundredth of a second,
	if you zoom out (<strong>Ctrl + 3</strong>) three times, this multiplies the
	step size by 8, resulting in a step size which is slightly less
	than a tenth of a second. As another example, if you press <strong>Ctrl + 2</strong>,
	and then <strong>Ctrl + 3</strong> 7 times, then the step size is about
	one and a half seconds.</p>
	

		 	
	<h2 id="selecting-audio">Selecting audio</h2>

	<p>In the case of an audio editor which can only edit a single audio track,
	then selecting audio simply consists of specifying the start and end times
	of the audio which you want to select, that is, a time range. For example
	you might want to select the audio between the times 1 minute 2 seconds and
	5 minutes 23 seconds.</p>

	<p>However, Audacity is a multi-track editor. If the project consists of a number
	of tracks, then you may want to select the audio on only some of the tracks for
	a given time range. So in Audacity, as well as having to select a time range,
	you also have to specify which tracks are selected. The selection of
	tracks was described in the
	<a href="#track-selection">track selection</a> section above, and
	selecting a time range is described in one of the following sections.</p>
	
	
	<h3 id="auto-select-option">Auto-select option</h3>
	
	<p>There is an option for auto-selection, if a selection is required,
	and this option is on by default. This option affects what happens,
	for example, if you try to apply an effect when no audio is selected,
	that is either no tracks are selected and/or no time range is selected.
	If this option is off, then a dialog opens telling you that no audio is selected.
	However, if this option is on, the
	effect is applied to either some or all of the audio in the project, depending
	on whether any tracks were selected and whether a time range was selected.</p>
	
	<p>Because the automatic selection of tracks and time-ranges occur with
	no audible feedback, then for users of screen readers it's recommended
	that you turn this option off, as described in the
	<a href="#auto-select">Auto-select section</a>
	of the Preferences section. All the instructions in the remainder
	of this guide assume that the option is off.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Selecting a time range</h3>
	
	<p>A quick way of selecting all of the audio in the project is to
	use the shortcut <strong>Ctrl + A</strong>: this selects all the
	tracks, and selects a time range which includes all the audio.</p>
	
	<p>There are two general ways of selecting a time range. One of these
	is described in the remainder of this section, and the other
	method, is described in the
	<a href="#selecting-a-time-range-using">Selecting a time range using the stored cursor position</a>
	section below.</p>
	
	<p>The first general way of selecting a time range consists of two steps:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Move the cursor to where you want to start or end the selection, using
		one of the methods described in the
		<a href="#moving-the-cursor">Moving the cursor section</a> above.</li>
		
		<li>Set the other end of the selection using one of the methods described
		below.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Note that when a time range is selected, playback plays the selected
	time range. There are also a number of additional playback commands which
	are described in the
	<a href="#playback-commands-for-checking">Playback commands for checking a selected time range section</a>.</p>
	
	<p>You can use any of the following methods for setting the other end of the selection:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>With the cursor at the position where you want the start of the
		selection, to set the end of the selection at the end of all the audio,
		press <strong>Shift + End</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>With the cursor positioned where you want the end of the selection,
		to set the start of the selection at the start of the tracks (time zero),
		press <strong>Shift + Home</strong>.</li>

		<li>Set the end of the selection using the <strong>]</strong> key during playback.
		If during playback you press <strong>]</strong> and then <strong>Spacebar</strong> to stop,
		the end of the selection is set at the point in the audio where you pressed
		the <strong>]</strong> key. In practice, the following method is
		more flexible:
		<ol>
			<li>During playback, press <strong>P</strong> to pause when you reach the position
			which you want to be the end of the selection.</li>
			<li>If you're unhappy with this position, press <strong>P</strong> to resume and using
			the Seeking/Jumping keys have another attempt to pause in the
			right place.</li>
			<li>Press <strong>]</strong> to mark the position for the
			end of the selection.</li>
			<li>Press <strong>Spacebar</strong> to stop.</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		
		<li>With the cursor at the position where you want the start of the
		selection, to set the end of the selection at the end of the audio in the
		selected tracks, press <strong>Shift + K</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>With the cursor positioned where you want the end of the selection,
		to set the start of the selection at the start of the audio in the selected tracks,
		press <strong>Shift + J</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>Using the selection controls on the selection bar, as described
		in the next section.</li>
		
		<li>Using <strong>Shift + Left Arrow</strong> or <strong>Shift + Right Arrow</strong>.
		With the cursor positioned where you want the start of the selection,
		you can press <strong>Shift + Right Arrow</strong> one or more times
		to move the end of the selection to the right in small steps.
		Similarly, with the cursor position where you want the end of the
		selection, you can press <strong>Shift + Left Arrow</strong> one or more
		times to move the start of the selection to the left. Adjusting the step size
		is described in the
		<a href="#step-size">Step size of the left an right arrow keys section</a>
		above. Note that Track table must be the focus to use these keystrokes.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h4>Setting the start or end of the selection using the selection controls</h4>
	
	<p>With the cursor positioned where you want to start the selection,
	to set the end of the selection:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Press <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong> to move to the Selection bar.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Tab</strong> to the selection details combo box, and set it
		to either start and end of selection, or start and length of selection.
		If you increase the value of either the length, or the End control, then the value of the
		start control remains unchanged at the initial cursor
		position.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Tab</strong> to the end or length control.</li>
		
		<li>If it's the End control, then increase its value. For
		example if you want to move the end of the selection to five
		seconds after the start of the selection, and assuming the format
		is set to hh:mm:ss + hundredths, then: press <strong>End</strong>
		to move to the last digit, press <strong>Left Arrow</strong> twice
		times to move to the seconds digit, and then press <strong>Up Arrow</strong>
		five times.</li>
		
		<li>If it's the Length control, then you can increase the
		value of the length by either by using <strong>Up Arrow</strong>,
		or by typing in digits, as described in the
		<a href="#edit-spin-boxes">Edit spin boxes</a> section,
		which is in the Selection bar section.</li>
		
		<li>Press <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong> twice to return to the Track table.</li>			
	</ol>
	
	
	<p>With the cursor positioned where you want the end of the selection,
	to set the start of the selection:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Press <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong> to move to the Selection bar</li>
		
		<li><strong>Tab</strong> to the selection details combo box, and set it
		to either start and end of selection, or length and end of selection.
		If you increase the value of either the length, or the start control, then the value of the
		end control remains unchanged at the initial cursor position.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Tab</strong> to the start or length control.</li>
		
		<li>If it's the start control, then decrease
		its value. For example, if you wanted to move the start of the selection
		to ten seconds before the end of the selection, and assuming that
		the format of the selection controls is set to hh:mm:ss + hundredths:
		press <strong>End</strong> to move to the last digit, then press
		<strong>Left Arrow</strong> three times to move to the tens of seconds digit,
		and then press <strong>Down Arrow</strong> once to decrease the
		time by 10 seconds.</li>
		
		<li>If it's the Length control, then you can increase the
		value of the length by either by using <strong>Up Arrow</strong>,
		or by typing in digits, as described in the
		<a href="#edit-spin-boxes">Edit spin boxes</a> section,
		which is in the Selection bar section.</li>
		
		<li>Press <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong> twice to return to the Track table.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>The second general method of selecting a time range consists of four steps:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Move the cursor to where you want to start or end the selection, using
		one of the methods described in the
		<a href="#moving-the-cursor">Moving the cursor section</a> above.</li>
		
		<li>Open the Select menu, and choose Store Cursor position.</li>
		
		<li>Set the other end of the selection, again using
		using one of the methods described in the
		<a href="#moving-the-cursor">Moving the cursor section</a> above.</li>
		
		<li>Open the Select menu, and choose Cursor to Stored Cursor position.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>In some circumstances, this method is easier to use than the method described in
	the previous section. Having stored the cursor position, you can use what ever method
	you want to position the cursor at the other end of the time range you want to select,
	without any danger that you'll loose the other end of the selection.</p>
	
	<p>Note that during playback, including when paused, the Store Cursor position command stores
	the position of the playback cursor, rather than the cursor used for editing. However, it's normally
	easier to position the edit cursor precisely where you want it, and so for selecting a time
	range, you probably won't want to store the position of the playback cursor very often.
	Similarly, during playback, including when paused,  the &ldquo;Cursor to Stored Cursor
	position&rdquo; on the Select sub menu selects from the position of the playback cursor
	to the stored cursor position.</p>
	
	
	<h3 id = "playback-commands-for-checking">Playback commands for checking a selected time range</h3>
	
	<p>When a time range is selected, then if you press <strong>Spacebar</strong> for playback,
	only the audio in the selected time range is played. In addition you can use
	the following playback commands to check that you've selected the time range which you want:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>To play a short period before or after selection start, press <strong>Shift + F5</strong>
		or <strong>Shift + F6</strong> respectively.</li>
		
		<li>To play a short period before or after selection end, press <strong>Shift + F7</strong>
		or <strong>Shift + F8</strong> respectively.</li>
		
		<li>To play a cut preview, press <strong>C</strong>. This plays back a short period before selection
		start, and then a short period after selection end. The selected time range itself is omitted.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The settings for the length of these periods all share the settings of the play
	cut preview command, and can be set in the playback category of Preferences.</p>
	
		
	<h3>Adjusting a selected time range</h3>
	
	<p>There are a couple of ways of making small adjustments to
	a selected time range, and they are described in the next two sections.</p>
	

	<h4>Adjusting the selected time range using keystrokes to move the start or end of the selection</h4>
	
	<p>You can use the following keystrokes to move the start or end
	of the selection by a small amount. Adjusting the step size
	is described in the
	<a href="#step-size">Step size of the left an right arrow keys section</a> above.</p>
		
	<ul>
		<li>To move the end of the selection to the right, so
		expanding the time range, press <strong>Shift + Right Arrow</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>To move the end of the selection to the left, so
		contracting the time range, press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Left Arrow</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>To move the start of the selection to the right, so
		contracting the time range, press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Right Arrow</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>To move the start of the selection to the left, so
		expanding the time range, press <strong>Shift + Left Arrow</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
			
	<p>Note that the two keystrokes that use <strong>Ctrl</strong>
	contract the selected time range, and the other two keystrokes expand
	the selected time range.</p>

	
	<h4 id="adjusting-using-the-selection-controls">Adjusting the selected time-range using the selection controls</h4>
	
	<ol>
		<li>If the current focus is the Track table, then press
		<strong>Ctrl + F6</strong> to move to the Selection bar.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Tab</strong> to the selection details combo box, and set the
		Start and end of selection option. This allows you to adjust the Start or the End of the
		selection without affecting the other one.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Tab</strong> to either the start or the
		end control. If the format isn't already set to
		hh:mm:ss + hundredths, then you probably want to do this so that
		you can make small adjustments to the times. The format can
		be changed using the context menu of the control.</li>
		
		<li>If, for example, you want to adjust the time in tenths of a
		second, press <strong>End</strong> to move to the last digit,
		and then press <strong>Left Arrow</strong> to move to the
		tenths of a second digit. You can then press <strong>Up Arrow</strong>
		or <strong>Down Arrow</strong> to increase or decrease the time by
		a tenth of a second respectively.</li>
		
		<li>Adjust the other selection control if desired.</li>
		
		<li>Press <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong> twice to return to the tracks.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<h3>Deselecting a selected time range</h3>

	<p>If you press any of the following keystrokes which move the cursor,
	then any selected time range is deselected: <strong>Home</strong>, <strong>End</strong>,
	<strong>J</strong>, <strong>K</strong>, <strong>Left Arrow</strong>,
	<strong>Right Arrow</strong>, <strong>Comma</strong>, and <strong>Period</strong>.
	After you have pressed <strong>Left Arrow</strong>
	or <strong>Right Arrow</strong>, then the cursor position
	is at the start or end of the selection which has just been deselected.</p>
	
	<p>To deselect all the tracks, and deselect any time-range, press
	<strong>Ctrl + Shift + A</strong>. The new cursor position is at
	the start of the selection which has just been deselected.</p>
	
	
	<h2 id="basic-editing">Basic editing</h2>
	
	<h3>Undo and redo</h3>
	
	<p>To undo press <strong>Ctrl + Z</strong>,
	and to redo press <strong>Ctrl + Y</strong>.</p>
	

	<h3>Deleting audio</h3>

	<p>To delete the selected audio, press the <strong>Delete</strong> key.</p>
	
	<p>If you want a preview of the audio after deletion,
	press <strong>C</strong> which plays back from a short time before
	the selected audio to a short time after the selected audio, but
	omitting the selected audio. The length of the times of playback before
	and after the selection can be set in the Cut Preview section of
	the Playback category in the Preferences dialog.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Cut</h3>
	
	<p>To cut the selected audio, press <strong>Ctrl+ X</strong>. The selected audio
	is removed from the tracks, and placed on the Audacity clipboard.</p>
	
	<p>As in the case of deleting audio, you can preview the effect of your cut by
	pressing <strong>C</strong> for Play cut preview.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Copy</h3>
	
	<p>To copy the selected audio onto the Audacity clipboard, press <strong>Ctrl + C</strong>.</p>
	
	
	<h3 id="paste">Paste</h3>
	
	<p>To paste the audio on the Audacity clipboard into the selected track or tracks,
	press <strong>Ctrl + V</strong>. There are two cases:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>If a time range is not selected, and so no audio is selected,
		then the audio is inserted at the position of the cursor.</li>
		
		<li>If some audio is selected, the selected audio is replaced
		by the pasted audio.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>There are a couple of convenient playback commands which can be used
	for checking that the transition at the start and end of the pasted audio sounds alright:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>To play a short period before and after selection start,
		press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + F5</strong></li>
		
		<li>To play a short period before and after selection end,
		press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + F7</strong></li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The settings for the length of these periods share the settings of the play
	cut preview command, and can be set in the playback category of Preferences.</p>

	
	<h3>Replace with silence</h3>

	<p>To replace the selected audio with the same length of silence,
	on the Edit Menu, open the Remove Special sub menu, and choose
	Silence Audio (<strong>Ctrl + L</strong>).</p>


	<h3>Insert silence</h3>
	
	<p>To insert a period of silence into the selected tracks:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Move the cursor to where you want to insert the silence.</li>

		<li>Choose Silence from the Generate menu.</li>

		<li>A Silence Generator dialog opens, and the focus is a spin box
		which allows you to specify the length of the silence. The spin box
		is identical to the spin boxes used on the Selection bar, though the
		first non-zero digit is the initial focus, rather than the first digit.
			
		 	<p>Set the time that you want,
			and then press <strong>Enter</strong> to press the default OK button.
			The period of silence is inserted, and a time-range which covers
			this period is selected.</p>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Note that all the commands on the Generate menu have the following behaviour.
	If one or more tracks are selected, but no time-range, then the generated
	audio is inserted at the cursor. However, if a time-range is also selected,
	then the selected audio is replaced by the generated audio. Also, all the spin
	boxes in the dialogs which are opened from the Generate menu have a default
	format of seconds, and the first non-zero digit is the initial focus, rather
	than the first digit.</p>


	<h3 id="effects">Effects</h3>

	<p>Audacity provides a large number of effects which are available on the
	Effects menu. Some of the commands, like fade in or fade out,
	simply execute the effect on the selected audio, but most of them
	open a dialog box so that you can adjust the parameters for the
	effect.</p>
	
	<p>If an effect does not support real-time preview, which is
	described in the next section, then its dialog nearly always
	contains a Preview button which
	allows you to hear a short sample of the effect applied to the
	selected audio. By default, the length of the preview is 6 seconds, but you
	can change this in the Preferences dialog, where in the Playback
	category there's a Length of preview edit box.</p>
	
	<p>The effect's dialog also contains a Manage button, which
	opens a menu which includes commands for presets.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Effects with real-time preview</h4>
	
	<p>Some of the effects which can be used Audacity include real-time
	preview &ndash; where you can change the settings of an effect during
	playback. A small number of the effects included with Audacity's installation,
	for example, the bass and treble effect and the wahwah effect,
	have this feature. In addition, if you have downloaded
	any VST or LADSPA effects, then these have real-time preview.</p>
	
	<p>The dialogs of effects which include real-time preview include the
	following controls, all of which have access keys:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Apply button, which applies the effect to the selected audio,
		and is the dialog's default button. Note that as with any other
		Apply button, it doesn't close the dialog.</li>
		
		<li>Close button (<strong>Esc</strong>).</li>
		
		<li>Manage button. This opens a menu which includes commands for presets,
		and opening an options dialog.</li>
		
		<li>Start/Stop Playback button. If you press Stop Playback during
		playback, and then press Start Playback, then playback resumes from
		where it was stopped.</li>
		
		<li>Skip Backward button. During playback, pressing this seeks backward
		by a short period. Otherwise, pressing it ensures that the next playback
		starts at the start of the selected time range.</li>
		
		<li>Skip Forward button. During playback, pressing this seeks forward
		by a short period. Otherwise, pressing it causes the next playback to
		start at the end of the selected time range.</li>
		
		<li>Enable check box. This sets whether the effect is enabled, and is
		checked by default. Unchecking this allows you to quickly compare the
		audio with and without the effect.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>After opening one of these effect dialogs, you can return to the main
	Audacity window without closing it. Dialogs with this behaviour are known
	as modeless dialogs. You can cycle round the Audacity main window and any
	open modeless dialogs by pressing <strong>Alt + F6</strong>. Because these
	effect dialogs have their own playback controls, you may not need to make
	use of the behaviour very often.</p>

	
	<h3>Deleting tracks</h3>
	
	<ul>
		<li>To delete the focused track, press <strong>Shift + C</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>To delete the selected track or tracks, choose Remove Tracks
		from the Tracks menu. This provides a quick way of deleting all
		the tracks if you first press <strong>Ctrl + A</strong>
		to make sure that all the tracks are selected.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h3>Avoiding introducing clicks when editing</h3>
	
	<p>If you delete or cut part of the audio in a track, and if the beginning or
	end of this part hasn't zero amplitude, then this can result if sudden changes
	in the amplitude of the audio. If the size of these sudden changes are large enough,
	then you'll hear them as clicks. A similar problem can occur if you copy and paste audio.</p>
	
	<p>You can avoid introducing these clicks by using the &ldquo;At Zero Crossings&rdquo;
	command, which is on the Select menu, and has the shortcut <strong>Z</strong>.
	If a track is selected, but there isn't a selected time range,
	then if you apply this command, the position of the cursor is moved to
	the nearest position where the amplitude of the audio in the selected track is zero.
	The change is position is very small, so you don't have to worry that this will make
	a large change to the cursor position. In a similar manner, if there's a selected time range,
	the positions of both the start and the end of the time range are adjusted so that the
	amplitude of the audio in the selected track is zero.</p>
	
	<p>So to avoid introducing clicks:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>After selecting part of the audio in a track, and before cutting, deleting or
		copying, apply the At Zero Crossings command.</li>
		
		<li>After you've positioned the cursor for pasting audio into a track, and
		before pasting, apply the At Zero Crossings command.</li>
	</ul>
	

	<h2 id="more-advanced-editing">More advanced editing</h2>
	
	<h3>Adding a new empty track</h3>
	
	<p>To add a new empty track, choose an option from the Add New
	sub-menu which is on the Tracks menu.</p>

	
	<h3 id="importing-audio-files">Importing audio files</h3>
	
	<p>You can import one or more audio files,
	and these become new tracks in the existing project. 
	To import standard audio file(s), open the
	File menu, and choose Audio from the Import sub-menu (<strong>Ctrl + Shift + I</strong>).
	A &ldquo;Select one or more audio files&rdquo; dialog opens, which
	has the same structure as a standard Windows XP Open dialog. Select one or
	more files, and press <strong>Enter</strong> to press the OK button.</p>
	
	<p>Note that immediately after the import, the last track in the
	project is selected, and all other tracks are unselected.</p>

	
	<h3>Duplicate</h3>
	
	<p>To duplicate the selected audio into new track or tracks, open
	the Edit menu and choose Duplicate (<strong>Ctrl + D</strong>).
	The duplicated audio retains the same timings as the original selected audio,
	so in the new track or tracks the audio data starts at the start of the selected
	time range.</p>
    
    
    <h3 id="align-the-audio-in-the-tracks-end-to-end">Align the audio in tracks end to end</h3>
    
    <p>If you select two or more tracks, you can align the audio in these
    tracks so that the audio in a track starts at the end of the audio
    in the previous track. To do this, open the tracks menu, open the
    Align tracks sub menu, and choose Align end to end. Notes:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>The order in which the audio in the selected tracks is aligned is the same
        as the order of these tracks in the track table. If you need to
        change the order of the tracks in the table, you can do this using
        commands on a track's <a href="#track-menu">track menu</a>.</li>
        
        <li>The position of the audio in the first selected track remains
        unchanged.</li>
    </ul>

	
	<h3>Time shift</h3>
	
	<p>Time shift clips???</p>
	
	<p>You can time shift the audio data in one or more selected tracks so that
	either the start or the end of the audio is at some desired position.
	You can specify this position either with the cursor, or the start or
	end of a selected time range. All the commands for moving the audio
	are available on the Align Tracks sub menu which is on the Tracks menu,
	and some examples of using them are given below.</p>
	
	<p>There are a couple of convenient playback commands which can be used
	for checking the position of the shifted audio:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>To play a short period before and after the cursor, or selection start,
		press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + F5</strong></li>
		
		<li>To play a short period before and after selection end,
		press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + F7</strong></li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The settings for the length of these periods share the settings of the play
	cut preview command, and can be set in the playback category of Preferences.</p>
	
	<h4>Examples</h4>
	
	<p>To move the audio in one or more tracks so that it
	starts at some desired time:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Move the cursor to the desired time, using any of the methods
		described in the
		<a href="#moving-the-cursor">Moving the cursor section</a>.</li>
		
		<li>Select the tracks containing the audio you want to move,
		and make sure that the other tracks are not selected.</li>
		
		<li>Open the Align Tracks sub menu on the Tracks menu, and choose
		Start to Cursor/Selection Start. Note that if more than one track has been selected,
		and the audio in these tracks start at different times, then the
		audio in all the tracks is moved by the same amount, so that the
		earliest audio in the tracks is positioned at the cursor.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>If you'd wanted to move the audio in one or more tracks so that it
	ended at some desired time, then you'd simply change step three to use
	the End to Cursor/Selection Start command, instead of Start to Cursor/Selection Start.</p>
	
	<p>As another example, if you want to time shift one or more tracks by a certain amount
	of time, then:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Select one or more tracks that you want to time shift, and make
		sure that the other tracks are not selected.</li>
		
		<li>Press <strong>J</strong> to  move the cursor to the start of the
		audio in the selected tracks.</li>
		
		<li>Press <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong> to move to the Selection bar, and
		then <strong>Tab</strong> to the End/Length radio buttons. Make sure
		that the Length option is selected.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Tab</strong> to the Selection Start spin-box.</li>
		
		<li>Depending on whether you want to time shift forward or backward,
		you now need to move the cursor forward or backward by incrementing
		or decrementing the time in the spin-box. For example,
		if you want to move the audio forward by 1.5 seconds, then
		use the following keystrokes to increment the time : <strong>End</strong> moves you to
		right most digit, which is hundredths of seconds; <strong>Left Arrow</strong>
		moves you to the tenths of second digit;
		<strong>Up Arrow</strong> five times increments this digit by five;
		<strong>Left Arrow</strong> moves you to the seconds digit;
		and finally, <strong>Up Arrow</strong> increments this digit by one.</li>
		
		<li>Go to the Align tracks sub-menu on the Tracks menu, and choose
		Start to Cursor/Selection Start. This moves the data in the selected selected tracks,
		so that is now starts at the modified cursor position.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Note that if you're wanting to move a track which you've recorded and
	which doesn't line up with the existing tracks, then you may need to move
	the start of the audio to earlier than
	time zero. Because you can't move the cursor before time zero,
	the above method has to be modified so that
	in step two, you press <strong>K</strong> to move to the end of the audio
	in the selected tracks, and then in step five, you use the End to Cursor/Selection Start
	command. Note that Audacity does have an automatic
	<a href="#latency-correction">latency correction</a>.</p>


	<h3 id="track-menu">Track menu</h3>
	
	<p>You can open the menu of a focused track by pressing <strong>Shift + M</strong>,
	or the <strong>Application key</strong>.
	The commands on the menu include renaming the track, and moving
    the track, and the latter is described in the next section.</p>
	
	
	<h3 id="moving-a-track">Moving a track</h3>
	
	<p>On the <a href="#track-menu">Track menu</a> there are commands for moving
	a track up, down, to the top, and to the bottom of the tracks. By default,
	these commands to not have keystrokes assigned to them, but you can assign
	your own keystrokes in the keyboard category of Preferences, which is described
	in the
	<a href="#keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard shortcuts section</a>, which is in
	the Preferences section. The names of
	the commands are move focused track up, down, to top, and to bottom.
	Keystrokes which are not currently used and are suitable include <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Up Arrow</strong>,
	<strong>Ctrl + Shift + Down Arrow</strong>, <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Home</strong>,
	and <strong>Ctrl + Shift + End</strong>.</p>

	
	<h3>Track gain</h3>
	
	<p>To change the gain of the focused track, press <strong>Shift + G</strong>.
	A Gain dialog opens which contains both an edit box and a slider for changing the gain.
	The range of gain (db) is -36 to +36.</p>
	
	<p>The gain of a track is applied to the whole track, and is only
	applied during playback, or when the track is exported to a file, or when you
	use the mix and render command. Changing the gain doesn't affect
	the amplitude of the audio data in the track.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Track pan</h3>
	
	<p>To change the pan of the focused track, press
	<strong>Shift + P</strong>. A Pan dialog opens which contains both
	an edit box and a slider for changing the pan.
 	The range of pan is -1 to 1, corresponding to left and right.</p>
	
	<h3>Track Mute and Solo</h3>
	
	<p>Each track has a mute setting which can be on or off, and
	a solo setting which can also be on or off. These settings are
	used to control which tracks contribute to playback, and in addition
	the mute settings, but not the solo settings, affect which tracks contribute to audio
	saved in one of the standard formats. By default, the mute and
	solo settings for each track are off. After reading the name of the track,
	Jaws says mute on, if the mute setting is on, and solo on,
	is the solo setting is on.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Mute</h4>
	
	<p>If a track's mute setting is on, then it doesn't contribute to playback, or
	to the audio saved in one of the standard formats. You can either
	change the mute setting of an individual track or the settings of
	all the tracks:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>To toggle the Mute setting of the focused track, press
		<strong>Shift + U</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>To mute all the tracks, press <strong>Ctrl + U</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>To set mute off for all the tracks, press
		<strong>Ctrl + Shift + U</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h4>Solo</h4>
	
	<p>If one or more tracks have their solo setting on, then only these
	tracks contribute to playback, regardless of the Mute settings of all of
	the tracks. To toggle the Solo setting of the focussed track,
	press <strong>Shift + S</strong>.</p>
	
	<p>There are a number of options for the solo setting and its interaction with
	the mute setting:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Simple, which is the default. when you turn on the Solo setting of
		a track, then the mute and solo settings of the tracks are adjusted so that
		the mute setting of the soloed track is off, and for all the remaining tracks,
		the mute setting is on, and the solo setting is off. If you turn off the solo setting
		of a track, then for all the remaining tracks, the mute setting is turned off.</li>
		
		<li>Multi-track. The mute and solo settings are completely independent.</li>
		
		<li>None. There's no solo setting, just a mute setting.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The setting which has these options can be found by going to the Tracks Behaviors
	category of the Preferences dialog, where there is a Solo button combo box.</p>
	
	
	<h4 id="sync-lock-tracks">Sync lock tracks</h4>
	
	<p>The idea of sync-lock tracks is to try and keep a group of tracks time
	synchronized with each other when some operation, such as deleting, affects
	the timing of one or more tracks in the group.</p>
 
	<p>Say you just had two audio tracks, and they were sync-locked. If you select
	one track and a time range, and delete the selected audio, then the audio in that
	time range in the unselected track is also deleted, so that all the remaining audio
	in the two tracks is still in sync with each other. Similarly with just two tracks
	which are sync locked, then if you select one track, and paste some audio into that
	track at the cursor position, then silence, with the same duration as the pasted audio,
	is pasted into the unselected track at the cursor position.</p>
	
	<p>You switch sync lock tracks on and off in the tracks menu, and by default it's off.
	If there are only audio tracks in the project, then there's just one group of sync-locked
	tracks. The tracks in a project can be divided up into more than one group using label
	tracks. Each audio track which follows immediately after a label track starts a new group.</p>
		 
	<p>When you select one or more tracks in a sync locked group, then an appropriate icon
	is shown in the track for sighted users, and the phrase "sync lock selected" is added to the
	name of the track for screen reader users.</p>
	

	<h2 id="labels">Labels</h2>
	
	<p>A label represents either a specific time position or a specific time range, and it can
	have a name. A label representing
	a specific time is referred to as a point label, and a label representing a
	specific time range is referred to as a region label.</p>
	
	<p>Labels are stored in Label tracks. There can be more than one Label track in a project,
	but normally a single label track is all that is needed. When a label track is the focus,
	then by default, pressing any letter or number automatically creates a new label,
	which normally isn't very helpful for users of screen readers. However there is a setting
	which allows you to turn this off, and it is highly recommended that you do this.
	In the Preferences dialog, in the Tracks category, there is a &ldquo;Type to create
	a label&rdquo; check box, which is checked by default, and which you can uncheck.</p>
	
	<p>You can label positions or time ranges as described in the next section,
	and then easily return to these later on in your editing using the commands
	described in the <a href="#moving-to-labels">Moving to labels section</a>.
	In addition, a number of the tools on the Analyze menu add a label track to
	the project which contains their results. For example, the Find clipping tool produces
	a label track containing labels at points where the audio has clipped.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Creating labels</h3>
	
	<p>There are two commands for creating labels, and both are on the Labels sub menu
	on the Edit menu:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Add Label at Selection (<strong>Ctrl + B</strong>). With no time range selected, this
		creates a point label for the position of the Cursor. If there is a selected
		time range, then it creates a region label for the time range.</li>
		
		<li>Add Label at Playback position (<strong>Ctrl + M</strong>), which creates
		a point label at the Playback position.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>To use either of these commands:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Either choose one of them from the Tracks menu, or press its keystroke.
		If the focused track isn't a label track, then the first label track below this
		track becomes the focused track, if such a track exists. If there isn't one,
		a new label track is appended to the existing tracks, and becomes the focused track.
		In the focused label track a new label is created, and an edit box is opened for entering
		a name for the label. Unfortunately Jaws does not say that the focus is now this
		edit box.</li>
		
		<li>Type in a name for the label (optional), and then press <strong>Enter</strong>
		to close the edit box.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h3 id="moving-to-labels">Moving to labels</h3>
	
	<p>There are two commands for moving to labels. For the purposes of working out which is the nearest
	label, the position of a region label is taken to be the start of its time range.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Move to next label (<strong>Alt + Right Arrow</strong>). This moves to the nearest label
		after the the cursor, or the start of a selected time range. If there's no label after this time,
		then it wraps round to the first label.</li>
		
		<li>Move to previous label (<strong>Alt + Left Arrow</strong>). This moves to the nearest label
		before the cursor, or the start of a selected time range. If there's no label before this time,
		then it wraps round to the last label.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Both these commands use the labels in a single label track, not all the label tracks in the project.
	If there is a single label track in the project, which is the usual case, then the commands use that
	track whatever track is the focus. If there is more than one label track in the project, then if the
	focused track is a label track this track is used, otherwise the first label track below the focused track,
	if one exits, is used.</p>
	
	<p>When these commands &ldquo;move to&rdquo; a label: if the label is a point label, then the cursor
	is set to the label's position; if the label is a region label, then a time range is selected using
	the label's time range. In both cases, Jaws says the name of the label, if it has one, followed by its
	position in the label track. If these commands are used during playback, then playback continues
	using the label's cursor position or time range.</p>
	
	<p>Note that if a label track is the focus, then the keystrokes <strong>Tab</strong>, and
	<strong>Shift + Tab</strong> for moving to the next or previous label are also available. However
	use of these keystrokes is not recommended. In addition to moving to a label, these keystrokes
	also open the name of the label for editing in an edit box which is not read properly
	by screen readers. If you accidentally use one of these keystrokes, then you can close
	the edit box by pressing <strong>Enter</strong>. If you need to edit the name of a label,
	you can use the Edit labels dialog, which is described in the next section.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Editing labels</h3>
	
	<p>The uses of the Edit labels dialog include renaming a label, deleting a label, and as an
	alternative to the move to label commands. To open
	the dialog, open the Edit menu, open the Labels sub menu, and choose Edit Labels.
	The dialog includes the following controls:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>A table which contains details the labels in all of the label
		tracks in the project, and which is described in the next section.</li>
		
		<li>Insert before, Insert After, and Remove buttons which can be used for
		editing the table.</li>
		
		<li>Import and Export buttons for importing labels from and exporting labels to a text file.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>When you open the dialog, one of the cells in the table is the focus and is selected. Assuming
	that the project contains at least one label, then one of the names of the
	labels is selected. In determining which name is selected, the position of a region label is taken
	as the start of its time range:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>If the cursor, or the start of a selected time range is at the position of a label,
		then the name of that label is selected.</li>
		
		<li>Otherwise, the name of the label which is the nearest label before this time is selected.</li>
		
		<li>If there is no label before this time, then the name of the first label is selected.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>When you close the dialog, either by pressing OK or cancelling it, then either the cursor or a time range
	is set using the label which is selected in the table, depending on whether the selected label is a point
	label or a region label.</p>
		
	<p>Note that opening the dialog when there are no labels in the project is not
	recommended. If you do so the table contains a single row, and
	the name of a label track is the focus and is selected. The name of the label is blank. 
	If you press the OK button, then a new label track is appended to the tracks in the project,
	and this track contains a label with a blank name. The best thing
	to do if you open the dialog in this state is to press <strong>Esc</strong> to cancel it. However
	even if you cancel, the cursor is set to time zero, and so you loose the previous position
	of the cursor.</p>
	
	
	<h4>The table</h4>
	
	<p>The table has six columns: the name of the label track, name of the label,
	start and end times, and low and high frequencies. If a label is a point label,
	then the start and end time have the same value. The low and high frequencies
	are for spectral selection, and are not covered in this guide.</p>
	
	<p>There are a number of ways of selecting a cell in the table:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>To select the next cell in the table, press
		<strong>Tab</strong> or <strong>Right Arrow</strong>. If the last
		cell is selected, pressing <strong>Tab</strong> moves you to the
		next control, which is the Add button.</li>
		
		<li>To select the previous cell in the table, press
		<strong>Shift + Tab</strong> or <strong>Left Arrow</strong>.
		If the first cell is selected, then pressing <strong>Shift + Tab</strong>
		moves you to the previous control which is the Cancel button at
		the bottom of the dialog.</li>
		
		<li>To select the cell directly below or above the current cell,
		press <strong>Down Arrow</strong> or <strong>Up Arrow</strong> respectively.</li>
		
		<li>To select the first or last cell, press <strong>Ctrl + Home</strong>
		or <strong>Ctrl + End</strong> respectively.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p> Note that because <strong>Tab</strong> can be used for selecting a cell
	in the table, there are a couple of keystrokes which move you
	directly out of the table. From any cell in the table, <strong>Ctrl + tab</strong>,
	and <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Tab</strong> move to to the next or previous control.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Deleting a label</h4>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Select any of the cells in the row representing the label.</li>
		
		<li>There are then two alternatives. The first is to press <strong>Ctrl + Tab</strong>
		to move to the first control after the table, <strong>Tab</strong> to the Remove button
		and press it. The second is to make use of the Remove button's access key, and to simply
		press <strong>Alt + R</strong>.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<h4>Editing cells</h4>
	
	<p>Jaws reads all the cells as if they were edit boxes. Just ignore this. None of the
	cells behave like standard edit boxes, and the way you edit a cell depends on the type
	of value it contains. The editing of the names of labels and the start and end times
	are described in the next two sections. In both cases you can confirm the edit by
	pressing <strong>Enter</strong> or <strong>Tab</strong>. The difference between
	the two is that <strong>Enter</strong> moves you the cell immediately below the current
	cell, and <strong>Tab</strong> moves you to the next cell. In addition, in both
	cases you can cancel the edit by pressing <strong>Esc</strong>.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Editing the name of the label</h4>
	
	<p>You can either overwrite or edit the current name:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>To overwrite the current name, simply type in some text, and
		then press <strong>Tab</strong> or <strong>Enter</strong> to confirm the edit,
		or <strong>Esc</strong> to cancel the edit.</li>
		
		<li>To edit the existing name, press <strong>F2</strong>, which
		selects the existing text. To deselect the text before editing,
		press <strong>Right Arrow</strong> or <strong>End</strong>
		which positions the current
		character immediately after the existing text, or press
		<strong>Home</strong> which makes the current character
		the first character in the text. To confirm the edit press
		<strong>Tab</strong> or <strong>Enter</strong>, or to cancel the edit press
		<strong>Esc</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h4>Editing the start or end time</h4>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Press <strong>F2</strong>. You can now edit the time in exactly
		the same way as you can edit the time controls such as Selection
		start in the Selection bar.</li>
		
		<li>To confirm the edit press <strong>Tab</strong> or <strong>Enter</strong>,
		or to cancel the edit press <strong>Esc</strong>.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Note that by default, the time format of the start and end times is the
	same as the time format of the time controls in the selection bar. You
	can temporarily change the time format by using the context menu
	of one the times when it is being edited. This changed format only
	applies to the time controls in the dialog, and the temporary change
	is not saved when then dialog is closed.</p>
	
	
	<h2 id="clips">Clips</h2>
	
	<p>In most of the rest of this guide, it has been assumed that an audio track contains
	a singe section of audio data. However, an audio track can contain a number of
	separate sections, and these are referred to as clips. In Audacity, clips can not
	overlap.</p>
	
	<p>There are a number of ways you can end up with more than one clip on a track:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>When you record at the end of an existing clip, then the recorded audio is
		added as a separate clip.</li>
		
		<li>Spit a clip into two clips.</li>
		
		<li>Paste some audio into a track which already contains a clip, and at a position
		which does not lie within the existing clip.</li>
		
		<li>Use of the various other commands.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	
	<h3>Moving the cursor</h3>
	
	<p>There are commands for moving both to the next and previous clip boundary,
	and these commands appear on the Cursor to sub menu of the Transport menu.
	The command to move the cursor to the next clip boundary moves the cursor to the next
	clip boundary after the cursor, or the end of the selected time range. The command
	to move the cursor to the previous clip boundary, moves the cursor to the previous
	clip boundary before the cursor, or the start of the selected time range.</p>
	
	<p>If any audio tracks are selected, then these commands find clip boundaries in
	these selected tracks. Otherwise, the commands find clip boundaries in all the audio tracks.</p>
	
	<p>When the cursor is moved to a clip boundary, Jaws says either start or end, followed by
	the number of the clip, followed by the name of the track. In the case where two clips
	are immediately next to each other, and the clip boundary is both the end of one clip
	and the start of the next, then Jaws says this.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Selecting a time range</h3>
	
	<p>There are two sets of commands for selecting time ranges which involve clip boundaries,
	and these are described in the next two sections. In both cases, if any audio tracks
	are selected, then the commands use the clips in the selected tracks. Otherwise,
	the commands use the clips in all the audio tracks.</p>

	
	<h4>Selecting previous or next clip</h4>
	
	<p>There are commands for both selecting the previous clip, and selecting the
	the next clip.They can be found on the Clip Boundaries sub menu of the Select
	menu, and they have shortcuts <strong>Alt + P</strong>, and <strong>Alt + N</strong>
	respectively. When a clip is selected, Jaws says the position of the clip in the
	track, followed by the name of the track.</p>
	
	<p>Note that you can also easily use these commands for moving to clip boundaries.
	Just select the relevant clip, and then press <strong>Left Arrow</strong> or
	<strong>Right Arrow</strong> to deselect the selection, and position the cursor
	at either the start or the end of the clip respectively.</p>
	
	<p>For those that are interested, the precise rules for determining which
	clips are selected when these commands are used are follows.</p>
	
	<p>For the Select next clip command:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>If there is no selected time range, then the first clip which starts
		either at or after the cursor position is selected.</li>
		
		<li>If the is a selected time range, then if the start of the selection is
		positioned at the start of the clip, and the end of the selection is before
		the end of the clip, then that clip is selected. Otherwise the first clip
		which starts after the start of the selection is selected.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>For the Select previous clip command:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>If there is no selected time range, the first clip
		which starts before the cursor is selected.</li>
		
		<li>If there is a time range selected, then if the start of the selection is
		positioned at the start of a clip, and the end of the selection is after
		the end of the clip, then that clip is selected. Otherwise, the first clip
		which starts before the start of the selection is selected.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h4>Selecting using clip boundaries</h4>
	
	<p>The two commands for selecting using clip boundaries can be used in more cases
	than the commands for selecting the next and previous clip which were described
	in the previous selection. They are also found on the Clip Boundaries sub menu
	on the Select menu, but they do not have keystrokes assigned to them by default.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Previous Clip Boundary to Cursor, sets the start of the selected time range
		to the previous clip boundary.</li>
		
		<li>Cursor to Next Clip Boundary, sets the end of the selected time range
		to the next clip boundary.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>When the start or the end of the selected time range is set to a clip boundary
	using these commands, Jaws gives the details of the clip boundary, in exactly
	the same way as when the commands for moving the cursor to a clip boundary are used.</p>


	<h3>Various split commands</h3>
		
	<h4>Split</h4>
	
	<p>To split a clip into two clips in a selected track:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Position the cursor where you want to split the clip.</li>
		
		<li>On the Edit menu, open the Split Boundaries sub menu, and choose Split.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>You can also split a clip into three parts using this method, if you select a time range.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Split delete, and Split cut</h4>
	
	<p>You can use the split delete and split cut commands to delete or cut the selected audio,
	without affecting the position of the contents of the track after the audio which was
	deleted or cut. This is in contrast to the standard
	cut and delete commands, which do cause subsequent contents to move.</p>
	
	<p>The effect of the the split delete command is as follows. For each track which is selected,
	any audio data in the selected time range is
	removed, and so the track becomes empty in that time range, and the position of
	any subsequent audio data in the track is left unchanged.</p>
	
	<p>For example, if in a selected track, the selected time range lies within a a clip, this
	clip is split into two clips. The first clip ends at the start of the selected time
	range. There is then a section of empty track, which is the length of the time range,
	and then the second clip starts at the end of the time range.</p>
	
	<p>As another example, if the start of the selected time range lies within the clip, and the
	end of the time range is at the end of the clip, then the clip is shortened &ndash; no
	new clips are created.</p>
	
	<p>The effect of the split cut command is the same as the split delete command, except that
	the audio that is removed is placed on the clipboard, rather than just being deleted.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Split New</h4>
	
	<p>The Split New command moves the selected audio to a new track or tracks, without affecting the
	position of any subsequent audio in the original track.</p>
	
	<p>For each track which is selected, any audio data in the selected time range is removed,
	and so the track becomes empty in the time range, and the position of the any
	subsequent audio data in the track is left unchanged. A new track is added after the
	last track, and the removed audio is pasted into this track at it's original position.</p>
	
	<p>You can think of Split new as being equivalent to Split cut, followed by the cut audio
	being pasted into a new track at the same position as the original selected audio.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Detach at silences</h4>
	
	<p>If the selected audio contains sections of complete silence, that is the amplitude of the
	audio is zero, then the Detach at Silences command can be used remove those
	sections of audio, leaving clips which separated from each other by the
	resulting sections of empty track.</p>
	
	<p>For each section in the selected audio where the amplitude of the audio is
	zero, the audio data is removed, resulting in a section of empty track,
	and the position of any subsequent audio data in the track is left unchanged.</p>
	
	<p>The detach at silences command is used to remove sections of audio where the
	amplitude is zero, and leave clips which don't con</p>
	
	
	<h3>Merging clips</h3>
	
	<p>To merge two clips in a selected track:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Select a time range such that the start of the time range is before the end of the first clip,
		and the end of the time range is after the start of the second clip. So for example, you could
		arrange for the start of the time range to be the start of the first clip, and the end of the time
		range to be the end of the second clip.</li>
		
		<li>On the Edit menu, open the Clip Boundaries sub menu, and choose Join (<strong>Ctrl+J</strong>).
		The clips are joined together, and any space between the clips is replaced by silence.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>In the above method, if there are other clips between the two clips, then they also will
	be merged into the final clip.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Time shifting clips</h3>
	
	<p>There are a couple of commands which can be used either to move a single clip,
	or a number of clips. The commands are Clip Left and Clip Right, and they appear
	on the Cursor sub menu of the Ext-Command menu, which is one of the
	<a href="#extra-menus">Extra menus</a>. By defaults no shortcuts are assigned to
	these commands, but if you use these commands frequently, you'll probably want to
	assign your own keystrokes.</p>
	
	<p>The Clip Left and Clip Right Commands move the clip or clips by a small amount to
	the left or right respectively. As in the case of using the arrow keys to move the cursor,
	the amount of movement depends on the Zoom setting, and the step size can be adjusted,
	as described in the <a href="#step-size">Step size of the left and right arrow keys section</a>
	of the Moving the Cursor section.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Moving a single clip</h4>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Move to the track which contains the clip which you want to move.</li>
		
		<li>Move the cursor so that it lies within the clip.</li>
		
		<li>Clip Left or Clip Right move both the clip and the cursor by a small amount. If the
		clip can not be moved, because it is immediately next to another clip, then Jaws says
		&ldquo;clip can not be moved&rdquo;</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>If the cursor is positioned at a clip boundary which is both the end of one clip and the
	start of the next clip, then for the purposes of moving clips, the cursor is considered
	to be within the second clip, and this is the clip which the commands use. Because
	of this, when you are placing the cursor within a clip to move it, it's recommended
	that you don't position the cursor at the end of the clip. If the cursor is at the end
	of a clip, then if you repeatedly use the Clip right command and the clip becomes
	immediately adjacent to the next clip, then the cursor will then be considered
	to lie within the next clip, and it is this clip, rather than the original clip
	that will move. This is unlikely to be what you want.</p>
	

	<h4>Moving a number of adjacent clips</h4>
	
	<p>To move a number of adjacent clips in a track:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Move to the track which contains the clips which you want to move.</li>
		
		<li>Select the track &ndash; the other tracks should not be selected.</li>
		
		<li>You then need to select a time range such that the start of the selection lies within
		the first clip you want to move, and the end of the selection lies within the last clip.
		So, for example you could move the cursor to the start of the first clip, and then
		set the end of the selection to the end of the last clip.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>In the case where other tracks are selected, in addition to the focused track, then in these
	tracks, all clips which include selected audio are also moved.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Moving clips when Sync lock tracks is enabled</h4>
	
	<p>The use of sync-lock tracks to keeps a group of tracks time synchronized was described
	in the
	<a href="#sync-lock-tracks">Sync lock tracks section</a>, which in the More advanced
	editing section. If sync lock tracks is enabled when you move either a single clip
	or a group of clips, then additional clips and labels may be moved. We will refer
	to the clips that would be moved if sync lock tracks was disabled, as the original
	set of clips to be moved.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>If a clip overlaps in time one of the clips to be moved, then it also will be moved.
		In fact, the rule is more general than this. For any clip, there exists a series of
		clips, starting with this clip and ending which a clip which will be moved, such that
		each pair of adjacent clips in this series overlap in time, then that clip will
		also be moved.</li>
		
		<li>If there are one or more label tracks in the sync locked group, then all the labels
		in those tracks will be moved, though it is not clear why this should be the case.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<p>These are some notes on the functionality of the clip left and clip right commands. The aim is that they
	have similar functionality to using the mouse with the shift tool. So Clip left/right is roughly equivalent
	to clicking in the focused track at the time given by selection start, and dragging one pixel to the
	left/right. To be more precise:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>If the focused track does not contain selected audio, then if selection start lies with a clip,
		that clip is moved, and selection start/the selection is also moved. (Using a mouse, selection
		start/the selection isn't moved.)</li>
		
		<li>If the focused track contains selected audio, then if selection start lies within a clip, then that clip,
		along with all the other clips in any track which include audio which is selected, are moved, and the
		selected time range is moved.</li>
		
		<li>If Sync lock tracks is one, then the relevant additional clips are moved.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	
	<h2 id="metadata-tags-editor">Metadata tags editor</h2>
	
	<p>Metadata is data which describes other data, and the
	metadata for audio files consists of a number of tags,
	where each tag is made up of a tag name and a tag value. The Metadata
	tags editor in Audacity allows you both to edit the values of a number
	of preset tags, and also to create your own custom tags.</p>
	
	<p>You can open the Metadata tags editor at any time by choosing
	Metadata from the Edit menu. In addition, if you save audio
	in one of the standard formats, then unless you've turned the
	appropriate option off, the Metadata tags editor
	automatically opens, as described in the
	<a href="#saving-audio">Saving audio section</a> above.</p>
	
	<p>The Metadata tags editor contains the following controls:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>A table which contains the names and values of the tags,
		and is described in the next section.</li>
		
		<li>Add, Remove, and Clear buttons which are used for editing the
		table. Pressing the Clear button deletes all the values
		of the preset tags, and all names and values of any custom tags.
		The Add and Remove buttons are described in the
		<a href="#creating-and-editing-custom-tags">creating and editing custom tags</a> section.</li>
		
		<li>A genres section, consisting of Edit and Reset buttons which
		are used for editing the preset list of genres, as described in the
		<a href="#editing-the-list-of-genres">Editing the list of genres section</a>
		below.</li>
		
		<li>A template section, which won't be described in this guide.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h3>The table</h3>
	
	<p>The table has two columns: Tag and Value, and the
	first 7 cells in the Tag column contain preset tag names
	such as Artist Name and Track Title. Jaws indicates that these preset
	tag names are not editable by saying unavailable after their names.</p>
	
	<p>There are a number of ways of selecting a cell in the table:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>To select the next cell in the table, press
		<strong>Tab</strong> or <strong>Right Arrow</strong>. If the last
		cell is selected, pressing <strong>Tab</strong> moves you to the
		next control, which is the Add button.</li>
		
		<li>To select the previous cell in the table, press
		<strong>Shift + Tab</strong> or <strong>Left Arrow</strong>.
		If the first cell is selected, then pressing <strong>Shift + Tab</strong>
		move you to the previous control which is the Cancel button at
		the bottom of the dialog.</li>
		
		<li>To select the cell directly below or above the current cell,
		press <strong>Down Arrow</strong> or <strong>Up Arrow</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>To select the first or last cell, press <strong>Ctrl + Home</strong>
		or <strong>Ctrl + End</strong> respectively.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p> Note that because <strong>Tab</strong> can be used for selecting a cell
	in the table, there are a couple of keystrokes which move you
	directly out of the table. From any cell in the table, <strong>Ctrl + tab</strong>,
	and <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Tab</strong> move to to the next or previous control.</p>

	
	<h3>Editing tag values</h3>
	
	<p>All the tag values except the genre tag value are edited using
	an edit box, but the genre tag value is edited with an edit combo
	box, which allows you to quickly choose from a list of genres.</p>
	
	<p>To edit any tag value, except the genre tag value,
	there are two options: either overwriting or editing the current value,
	as described below.
	Both involve using the keystrokes <strong>Enter</strong> or
	<strong>Tab</strong> to confirm the edit. <strong>Enter</strong> selects
	the cell immediately below the current cell, and
	<strong>Tab</strong> selects the next cell, which is the tag
	name in the next row.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>To overwrite the current value, simply type in some text, and
		then press <strong>Tab</strong> or <strong>Enter</strong> to confirm the edit,
		or <strong>Esc</strong> to cancel the edit.</li>
		
		<li>To edit the existing value, press <strong>F2</strong>, which
		selects the existing text. To deselect the text before editing,
		press <strong>Right Arrow</strong> or <strong>End</strong>
		which positions the current
		character immediately after the existing text, or press
		<strong>Home</strong> which makes the current character
		the first character in the text. To confirm the edit press
		<strong>Tab</strong> or <strong>Enter</strong>, or to cancel the edit press
		<strong>Esc</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>To edit the genre tag value:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>As in the case of other tag values, you can start the edit
		either by just starting to type, or by pressing <strong>F2</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>You can use the <strong>Up Arrow</strong> and <strong>Down Arrow</strong>
		keys to select a genre from the preset list of genres. To quickly
		find a genre beginning with a given letter, type this letter,
		and then press <strong>Down Arrow</strong> to move through all
		the genres beginning with that letter.</li>
		
		<li>To confirm the edit press <strong>Tab</strong> or <strong>Enter</strong>, and to
		cancel the edit press <strong>Esc</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h3 id="creating-and-editing-custom-tags">Creating and editing custom tags</h3>
	
	<p>You can use the rows in the table after the preset tags to create
	your own custom tags. In these rows you can edit both the tag
	name and the tag value.</p>
	
	<p>For a new set of metadata, there's one spare row after the
	preset tags. You can add and remove rows from the table using
	the Add and Remove buttons which follow the table. The
	Add button appends a row, and the Remove button removes the current
	custom row.</p>
	
	
	<h3 id="editing-the-list-of-genres">Editing the list of genres</h3>
	
	<p>To edit the list of genres which is available in the edit-combo
	box when you edit the genre value:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Press the Edit button in the Genres section.</li>
		
		<li>An Edit Genres dialog opens. The first control is a multi-line
		edit box which contains the genres, one genre on each line.
		Note that when you first open the dialog, all the genres are
		selected, so unless you type a text navigation keystroke first,
		for example <strong>Right Arrow</strong>, you'll overwrite all
		the genres. To move to the top or bottom of the list press
		<strong>Ctrl + Home</strong> or <strong>Ctrl + End</strong>
		respectively.</li>
		
		<li>When you've finished editing, <strong>Tab</strong> to the
		OK button and press it.</li>
	</ol>

	default OK button.</p>
	
	

	
	
	<h2 id="recording">Recording</h2>
	
	<p>The next three sections on settings, recording controls, and
	adjusting the recording level cover material which is relevant to
	nearly all recording. After that there's a latency correction
	section, which describes how Audacity can correct for the
	delay in the recorded audio when recording a
	vocal track whilst listening to existing tracks.</p>
	

	<h3 id="recording-settings">Recording settings</h3>
	
	<p>There are a number of settings which may need changing before
	you make a recording, and they're described in the following sections. Note
	that a number of these settings can be made either in the Devices section
	of the Preferences dialog or an individual dialog, or the Device Toolbar.</p>
    
    
	<h4 id="audio-interface">Audio interface</h4>
    
    <p>Audacity provides a number of options for the software interface which
    Audacity uses to interact with the playback and recording devices:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>MME (Multimedia extensions). This is the default interface.</li>
        
        <li>Windows DirectSound.</li>
        
        <li>Windows WASAPI (Windows audio session API), which is only available
        in Windows Vista and later. When using this interface, the recording
		devices also include the so called loopback versions of
        the playback devices. Using these, you can record the audio which is
        sent to one of these playback devices. This offers an alternative to
        the &ldquo;stereo mix&rdquo; recording device which may or may not be
        provided by your sound card.</li>
    </ul>
	
	<p>You can set this option using either the Interface host combo box in
	the Devices category of the Preferences dialog, or the Audio host
	combo box in the Select Audio Host dialog (<strong>Shift + H</strong>),
	or the Audio Host combo box on the Device toolbar. Note that when you
	change this option, the settings of the recording and playback devices may
	change, and so you should check these settings.</p>


	<h4>Recording device</h4>
	
    <p>You can select the recording device using either the recording device
    combo box in the Devices category in the Preferences dialog, or the recording
	device combo box in the Select Recording Device dialog (<strong>Shift + I</strong>),
	or the recording device combo box on the Device toolbar.</p>
	
	<p>If an onboard sound chip or an internal sound card has a number of
	possible inputs, such as microphone or line in, then each of these
	inputs is listed as a separate device in the combo boxes. In addition,
    if you're using either the MME or the DirectSound audio interface, then the
	available devices may also include either &ldquo;Microsoft Sound Mapper - Input&rdquo;
	or &ldquo;Primary Sound Captive Driver&rdquo;, respectively. Both of these correspond to
	the device which has been set as the default recording device in Windows.</p>
	
	<p>In Windows 7 and later these combo boxes list all the recording devices
	which were plugged in and enabled when audacity was opened. If a device
	isn't listed, then check the Recording
	page of Windows Sound dialog to see if the device is enabled. This
	dialog is described in the
	<a href="#sound-dialog-in-windows">Sound dialog in Windows  section</a>, for those
	unfamiliar with this dialog.</p>
	
	
	<h4 id="recording-level">Recording level</h4>
	
	<p>This section describes which control to use to adjust the recording level. How to adjust
	the recording level so that you don't get too much noise or clipping is described in the
    <a href="#adjusting-the-recording-level">Adjusting the recording level section</a>
    below.</p>
    
    <p>If Audacity can control the level of the recording device, then you can
    use either Audacity's recording slider, or the appropriate Windows control.
    It's normally easier to use the recording slider in Audacity,
    which is in the Mixer toolbar in the Toolbars section
    of Audacity's main window. To move to it from the Track table, press
    <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong> twice, and then <strong>Tab</strong> or
    <strong>Shift + Tab</strong> until you get to the recording slider.</p>
    
    <p>When Audacity can't control the level of the recording device, this
    is indicated by the recording slider being unavailable.
	For sighted users, the slider appears greyed out, and for users of
	screen readers, you can't Tab to it. In these cases you have to use the appropriate
    control which is part of Windows, as described below.</p>
    
    <p>Whether Audacity can control the recording level depends to a large extent on
    the audio interface which you are using:</p>
        
    <ul>
        <li>MME or Direct Sound. For many recording devices, you can use
        Audacity's recording slider.</li>
		
        <li>WASAPI. For the loopback devices provided by the WASAPI interface,
        the recording level depends only on the volume levels set in the programs
        which are sending their output to the playback device which you're recording.
        It doesn't depend on the Windows volume of the playback device,
        or the recording and playback sliders in Audacity.</li>
    </ul>
		
	<p>The location of the Windows' control to adjust the level of a recording
    device is described in the
	<a href="#sound-dialog-in-windows">Sound dialog in Windows section</a>.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Number of recording channels</h4>
	
	<p>The number of channels of the recording device can be set using either
	the recording channels combo box in the Devices category of the Preferences
	dialog, or the recording channels combo box in the Select Recording Channels
	dialog (<strong>Shift + N</strong>), or the Recording Channels combo box in
	the Device toolbar. If you're recording using a microphone, then the
	appropriate setting depends whether it's a mono or stereo microphone.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Sampling</h4>
	
	<p>The default sampling rate for a new project is 44100Hz, and the default
	sampling format is 32-bit float. These should be fine, but they can be
	changed in the Quality category of the Preferences dialog, as described in
	the <a href="#sampling">Sampling section</a> of the Preferences section.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Overdub option</h4>
	
    <p>The Overdub option controls whether Audacity plays any
    existing tracks while recording a new one. You can check or
    uncheck this option either on the Transport Options sub menu on the Transport menu,
	or in the Recording category of the Preferences dialog.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Software Playthrough option</h4>
	
    <p>The Software Playthrough option controls whether Audacity
    plays the new track while it is being recorded. Normally this
    option should be off, but it's useful if you want to hear what
    you're recording from a device such a USB turntable. It can
    be checked or unchecked either on the Transport Options sub menu on the Transport menu,
	or in the Recording category of the Preferences dialog.</p>	
	
	
	<h3 id="recording-controls">Recording controls</h3>
	
	<p>When you record, there are two options for where the recorded
	audio is placed. It can be placed either in a newly created track,
	or appended to an existing track. Please note that in Audacity 2.2.0
	the two corresponding recording commands have changed, and their
	shortcuts have been swapped round. However, there is an option for having
	the original commands and shortcuts, and this will be described
	below.</p>
	
	<p>The recording controls using default settings are:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>To start recording, with the recorded audio appended to the audio in
		an existing track, press <strong>R</strong>, or on the Transport menu,
		open the Record sub menu, and choose Record.  If the project already
		contains one or more audio tracks, then recorded audio is appended
		to either the first selected audio track, or if no tracks are selected,
		the first audio track. So if there's just a single
		audio track in the project, then the recorded audio is appended
		to this track, whether or not the track is selected. If the project
		contains no audio tracks, then the recorded audio is inserted into
		a new track.</li>
		
		<li>To start recording, with the recorded audio inserted into
		a new track, press <strong>Shift + R</strong> or on the Transport menu,
		open the Record sub menu, and choose Record New Track. A new track is
		automatically added to the project, and the default name
		of the new track is &ldquo;Audio Track&rdquo;. Note that Jaws reads
		this name as Track n, where n is the row number of the track.
		The recorded audio is inserted at the cursor position. (If
		there are initially no tracks in the project, then the cursor
		position is normally at time zero.) The new track is initially
		not selected.</li>
	
		<li>To pause or resume recording, press <strong>P</strong>.</li>

		<li>To stop recording, press <strong>Spacebar</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Note that during a recording, the second section of the status bar contains
	the maximum length of recording you can make given your free disk space.</p>
	
	<p>As mentioned above, there is an option to have the original recording commands
	and shortcuts, and those of you that have used Audacity for some time may well find
	it less confusing to continue using them. In the Recording category of Preferences,
	there is an &ldquo;Always record on a new track&rdquo; check box, which is not checked
	by default. If this check box is checked then the two commands to start recording are:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>To start recording with the recorded audio inserted into a new track,
		press <strong>R</strong>, or on the Transport menu, open the Record
		sub menu, and choose Record.</li>
		
		<li>To Start recording, with the recorded audio appended to the audio in
		an existing track, press <strong>Shift + R</strong>, or on the Transport menu,
		open the Record sub menu, and choose Append Record.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h3 id="adjusting-the-recording-level">Adjusting the recording level</h3>
	
	<p>There is a Recording meter in the Toolbars section of the Audacity window
	for helping to set up the recording level. The meter contains a Record meter
	drop down button, and you can move to this button by pressing <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong>
	twice to move to the toolbars, and then pressing <strong>Tab</strong> until you get to it.</p>
	
	<p>If you press this button by pressing <strong>Enter</strong>, then a menu opens
	which contains commands for controlling the meter. You can start and stop monitoring
	using this menu, and the meter also automatically monitors the input
	signal during recording. To make the meter accessible for screen reader users, the
	following information is included in the name of the drop down button
	which is read out by screen readers:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>The peak level. This is the maximum amplitude during the monitoring session,
		and it is automatically reset when monitoring starts.</li>
		
		<li>The word monitoring, if monitoring is in progress.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>The peak level can be given using two different scales:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>A linear scale, where the values are in the range 0 to 1.</li>
		
		<li>A logarithmic scale, where the maximum value is 0 decibels (dB),
		and lower values are increasingly negative. For example a value of
		0.5 on the linear scale corresponds to -6 dB.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>By default, the peak value is given in dB, but you can change this by:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Press the record meter drop down button by pressing <strong>Enter</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>Choose Options. The Recording Meter Options dialog opens.</li>
		
		<li>Set the Meter Type radio buttons to dB or linear.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>To adjust the recording level using the recording meter, go round the following loop
	until you are happy with the setting:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Change the recording level. If this is the first time round
		this loop, set the level to your best guess.</li>
		
		<li>Press the record meter drop down button, and choose Start monitoring.</li>
		
		<li>Make some representative noises for a short while.</li>
		
		<li>Press the record meter drop down button, and choose Stop monitoring. The
		name of the drop down button now includes the peak level of this monitoring
		session. On the basis of this value, decide if you need to repeat this loop with
		a different setting of the recording level as discussed below.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Normally a good value of the peak level to aim for is about -6db, which corresponds to
	0.5 on the linear scale. This should ensure
	that the recording level is both low enough so that distortion or clipping doesn't occur,
	and high enough so that you don't get an unnecessary amount of noise.</p>
    
	
	<h3 id="latency-correction">Latency correction</h3>
	
	<p>If you record a vocal track whilst listening to one or more existing tracks,
	then due to various delays, the newly recorded track won't be in
	sync with the original tracks. The total delay is known as the
	latency and some of the factors which affect its size are:
	the recording and playback devices, the size of the audio buffers
	within Audacity, and the audio interface being used (for example, MME or
	DirectSound).</p>
	
	<p>Audacity can automatically correct for the latency, once the
	latency has been measured, as described below. In the
	Preferences dialog, under the Recording category, there's a
	Latency correction edit box, where the units of the correction
	are milliseconds. If you record audio in a new track, then
	the audio is automatically moved later in time by this latency
	correction. So to shift the audio earlier in time to offset the
	latency, the number should be negative.</p>
	
	<p>The default value of the latency correction is -130 milliseconds.
    The default value will be only roughly correct for a particular recording
	set up, and it's recommended that you measure the actual latency.</p>
	
	<p>The following method for measuring the latency when using
	a microphone for recording is accurate to about 10ms, which normally
	should be good enough. It consists of the following three parts,
	which will be described in detail in the following sections:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Generate a rhythm track, which consists of a series of
		clicks with 1 second spacing.</li>
		
		<li>Record this rhythm track. Due to latency and its current
		correction, the clicks in the recorded track may occur before
		or after the clicks in the original track.</li>
		
		<li>With the help of the selection start spin box in the
		Selection bar, find the position of the click in the recorded track
		which corresponds to the click at 1 second in the generated track,
		and work out a new correction.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<h4>Generate a rhythm track</h4>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Choose Rhythm Track from the Generate menu.</li>
		
		<li>The second control is the Tempo [beats per minute] edit
		box, and its default value is 120. Type 60, and then
		press <strong>Tab</strong> twice to move to the next edit
		box.</li>
		
		<li>The Beats per measure [bar] edit box has a default value
		of 4. Type in the number 1, and then press <strong>Enter</strong>
		to press the default OK button.</li>
		
		<li>The rhythm track is created. The track is initially selected,
		and a time range is selected which includes all the audio.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<h4>Record the rhythm track</h4>
	
	<p>To record the rhythm track being played back through your headphones,
	you'll obviously need to take them off temporarily. If you're using
	a separate microphone, rather than a headset microphone, then position
	it close to the headphones so that it can pick up the clicks.
	Start recording in a new track (<strong>Shift + R</strong>, by default), and then press
	<strong>Spacebar</strong> to stop the recording after a handful
	of clicks.</p>
	
	<p>With the first track still being the focus, press 
	<strong>Shift + U</strong> to mute it, and then playback the
	recorded track. If the clicks are very quiet
	compared to Jaws, then amplify the track:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Deselect the first track, and select the second track</li>
		
		<li>Press <strong>Home</strong>, then <strong>Shift + End</strong>
		to select a time range.</li>
		
		<li>Choose Amplify from the effects menu.</li>
		
		<li>In the Amplify dialog, just press <strong>Enter</strong>
		to accept the default amplification.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<h4>Find the position of a click in the recorded track</h4>
	
	<p>The following instructions describe how to find the position
	of the recorded click which corresponds to the click which occurs
	at 1 second in the generated track, and then update Audacity's
	latency correction. It's assumed that the original track is still
	muted from when you checked the level of the recorded track above.</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Press <strong>Home</strong> to set both the selection
		start and selection end/length spin boxes in the selection bar
		to zero.</li>
		
		<li>Press <strong>Ctrl + F6</strong> to move to the selection
		bar. <strong>Tab</strong> to the End/Length radio buttons, and
		make sure that the Length option is selected.</li>	
		
		<li>Then <strong>Tab</strong> to the Selection Start spin box,
		and  change the format to hh:mm:ss + milliseconds using
		its context menu.</li>
		
		<li>To set the selection start to 1 second, press <strong>End</strong>
		to move to the last digit (milliseconds), press
		<strong>Left Arrow</strong> three to move to the seconds
		digit, and then press <strong>Up Arrow</strong> to increment it to one.</li>
		
		<li>Press <strong>Spacebar</strong> to listen to the first few clicks.
		There are two cases: if the recorded click is later than the
		original click at 1 second, then time to the first click is much less than
		the one second spacing of the remaining clicks; if the recorded click
		is earlier than original click, then the time
		to the first click is roughly the same as the one second spacing
		between the remaining clicks. Finding the position of the recorded
		click, and modifying Audacity's latency correction is described for
		these two cases in the following steps.</li>
		
		<li>To find the position of the recorded click when it's later
		than the original click, move to the 10 millisecond digit by
		pressing <strong>End</strong> to move to the last digit, and then
		pressing <strong>Left Arrow</strong>. Then go round the loop of incrementing the
		selection start by 10 milliseconds by pressing <strong>Up Arrow</strong> and then pressing
		<strong>Spacebar</strong> to check the time to the first click.
		When you've just gone past the click, the time to the first click will suddenly change
		to roughly a second. Decrement the selection start by 10 milliseconds
		so that you can still hear the first click almost immediately,
		and then press <strong>Insert + Up Arrow</strong> to read the
		number of milliseconds. Adjust the latency correction by subtracting
		this number from it. For example, if the initial correction was
		-130ms, and the recorded click was 40ms late, then the latency
		correction should be changed to -170ms.</li>
		
		<li>To find the position of the recorded click when it's earlier
		than the original click, move to the 10 millisecond digit by
		pressing <strong>End</strong> to move to the last digit, and then
		pressing <strong>Left Arrow</strong>. Then go round the loop of decrementing the
		selection start by 10 milliseconds by pressing <strong>Down Arrow</strong>, and then pressing
		<strong>Spacebar</strong> to check the time to the first click.
		When you move to just before the click, or during it, the click
		will suddenly sound immediately. Press <strong>Up Arrow</strong>,
		followed by <strong>Down Arrow</strong> to leave the time unchanged, but to get Jaws
		to read the number of milliseconds. Subtract this number from
		1000 to get the number of milliseconds by which the recorded click
		was early. Then adjust the latency correction by adding this
		number to it. For example, if the initial correction was -130ms
		and the recorded click was 20ms early, then the latency correction
		should be changed to -110ms.</li>
	</ol>
    
    
	
	<h2 id="preferences">Preferences</h2>
	
	<p>The Audacity Preferences dialog allows you to adjust many
	of the settings in Audacity. After a brief description of the
	dialog box, the following sections describe some of the more
	common settings.</p>

	<h3>Audacity Preferences dialog box</h3>

	<p>To open this dialog box, choose Preferences on the Edit menu
	(<strong>Ctrl + P</strong>).</p>

	<p>On the left hand side of the dialog is a tree view which contains
	a list of categories. To the right of this tree view are controls
	for setting the options which correspond to the category which is selected
	in the tree view. The dialog's default button is the OK button.</p>
	
	
	<h3 id="extra-menus">Extra menus</h3>
	
	<p>There are two extra menus which are not shown in the menu bar by default:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>The Ext-Bar menu, which contains commands associated with the toolbars,
		but which are not included in the standard menus.</li>
		
		<li>The Ext-Command menu, which contains the other commands which are
		not included in the standard menus.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>You can change whether or not these menus are shown either by using the
	Extra menus option in the View menu, or by using a setting in Preferences:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>In the Audacity Preferences dialog, select the Interface category.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Tab</strong> to the Show Extra Menus check box, and either
		check or uncheck it.</li>
	</ol>
	

	<h3 id="seek-times">Seek times</h3>

	<p>Whilst playing, you can jump (seek) forward or backward by either
	a short or long period. To set the values of the short and long periods:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>In the Audacity Preferences dialog, select the Playback category.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Tab</strong> to the Seek Time when playing section
		which contains two edit boxes: Short period and Long period.
		Both times are in given in seconds.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<h3 id="auto-select">Auto-select</h3>
	
	<p>The Auto-select option is described in the
	<a href="#auto-select-option">Auto-select option section</a> of the
	Selecting audio section above. This option is on by default, but
	for users of screen readers, it's recommended that it is
	turned off. To set this option either on or off:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>In the Audacity Preferences dialog, select the Tracks Behaviors category.</li>
		
		<li>Set the &ldquo;Auto-select, if selection required&rdquo;
		check box to be either checked or unchecked.</li>
	</ol> 
	
	
	<h3 id="lame-mp3-encoder-library">LAME MP3 encoder library</h3>
	
	<p>Until recently, there were legal issues about patents which meant
	that Audacity could not include an MP3 encoder as part of its default
	installation. These patents have now expired, but Audacity has not
	been updated to take advantage of this, and you still have to
	download a separate library.</p>

	<p>To download and install the LAME library:</p>	
	
	<ol>
		<li>Go the website whose address is
		<a href="http://lame.buanzo.org/#lamewindl">lame.buanzo.org/#lamewindl</a> .</li>
		
		<li>On this page, find the link which starts with lame and
		ends with windows.exe, and then open it to download
		a file  which has the same name as the link.</li>
		
		<li>Open the downloaded file, and a setup wizard opens. The
		default location for the LAME library is a newly created
		Lame for Audacity folder in either the Program Files (x86) folder on
		64-bit Windows, or the Program Files folder on 32-bit Windows.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<h3 id="ffmpeg-library">FFmpeg library</h3>
	
	<p>The FFmpeg library contains decoders and encoders which enable
	Audacity to open and save files in formats which are not
	supported by the standard installation of Audacity. The FFmpeg
	library is not included with Audacity due to legal issues
	about patents. Nearly all encoders are covered by one or more
	patents, but these patents aren't recognized in all countries. The
	<a href="http://www.ffmpeg.org/legal.html">FFmpeg License and Legal Considerations page</a>
	of the FFmpeg website contains a few comments on these issues.</p>
	
	<p>To download and install the FFmpeg library:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Go the website whose address is
		<a href="http://lame.buanzo.org/#lamewindl">lame.buanzo.org/#lamewindl</a> .</li>
		
		<li>On this page, find the link ffmpeg-win-2.2.2.exe, and then open it to download
		a file  which has the same name as the link. Note that if the link on the page is
		to a version later than 2.2.2 then that will be OK too.</li>
		
		<li>Open the downloaded file, and a setup wizard opens. The
		default location for the FFmpeg library is a newly created
		FFmpeg for Audacity folder in either the Program Files (x86) folder on 64-bit Windows,
		or the Program Files folder on 32-bit Windows.</li> 
	</ol>	
	
	<p>Then, the next time Audacity is opened, it automatically finds the
	FFmpeg library.</p>
		
	
	<h3 id="metadata-tags-editor-opens-during-export">Metadata tags editor opens during export</h3>
	
	<p>To set whether the Metadata tags editor automatically opens each
	time you export audio:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>In the Audacity Preferences dialog, select the Import/Export
		category.</li>
		
		<li>Move to the &ldquo;Show Metadata tags Editor prior to export step&rdquo;
		check box, which is in the When exporting tracks to an audio file
		section. This check box is checked by default.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<h3 id="sampling">Sampling</h3>
	
	<p>To set the sampling rate and format for a new project:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>In the Audacity Preferences dialog, select the Quality category.</li>
		<li><strong>Tab</strong> to the Sampling: Default Sample Rate combo box. For music,
		set the rate to 44100 Hz, but for speech 22050 Hz is OK if you
		you need to keep file sizes to a minimum.</li>
		<li><strong>Tab</strong> to the next control which is the
		Sampling: Default Sample Format combo box. Audacity recommend that
		you leave this on 32-bit float, but for speech 16-bit is fine.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<h3 id="type-to-create-a-label">Type to create a label</h3>
	
	<p>The Type to create a label option is described in the
	<a href="#labels">Labels section</a>. This option is checked by default, but
	for users of screen readers, it's recommended that it is unchecked:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>In the Audacity Preferences dialog, select the Tracks Behaviors category.</li>
		
		<li>Uncheck the &ldquo;Type to create a label&rdquo;
		check box.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<h3>Recording options</h3>
	
	<p>A number of recording options can be set in the Preferences dialog,
	and these are described in the
	<a href="#recording-settings">Recording settings section</a> of the
	Recording section.</p>
	
	
	<h3 id="keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
	
	<p>The Keyboard category of Audacity Preferences enables you to
	change the keyboard shortcut for any of the commands in Audacity.</p>
	
	<p>The first three controls are:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>A group of radio buttons which controls how the commands and
		associated shortcuts are displayed: View by Tree, Name, and Key.
		These are described in the next three sections.</li>
		
		<li>An edit box, which allow you to search for commands
		and shortcuts, as described in the <a href="#searching">Searching section</a>.
		The name of this edit box is Search if the View by setting is Tree or Name,
		and Hotkey if the setting is Key.</li>
		
		<li>A tree view or a list of commands, depending
		on which View by radio button is selected.</li>
	</ul>

	
	<h4>View by tree</h4>
	
	<p>The commands are displayed as a tree view, and if a command has a shortcut
	associated with it, then this appears after the name of the command.</p>
	
	<p>The tree view contains the following items:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Each of the menus in the menu bar. Each menu contains
		the commands in than menu, and any sub-menus contain the
		commands that sub menu.</li>
		
		<li>Command, which contains the commands which are not
		included in the menus in the menu bar.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h4>View by name</h4>
	
	<p>The commands are displayed as a list which is sorted alphabetically
	be the name of the command. If a command has a shortcut assigned to
	it, then this is displayed after the name of the command.
	Note the if the command appears in a sub menu,
	then the name of the command is prefixed with the name of the sub menu,
	for example &ldquo;Add New - Audio Track&rdquo;. This is so that commands
	which have the same name, but which appear in different sub menus
	can be distinguished from one another.</p>
	
	
	<h4>View by Key</h4>
	
	<p>The commands are displayed using a list of commands, and if the command
	has a shortcut assigned to it, this is displayed before the name of
	the command. The commands with shortcuts are listed first, and these are
	sorted alphabetically by the command's shortcut. The commands without shortcuts
	are then listed alphabetically by the name of the command.
	As in the case of View by name, if a command appears in a sub menu, then the name
	of the command is prefixed with the name of the sub menu.</p>
	
	
	<h4 id="searching">Searching</h4>
	
	<p>You can search for a command or commands using the Filter edit box. The
	search results are shown in the tree view or the list as soon as anything is
	entered in the edit box &ndash; you don't have to press enter. The details of
	the search depend on the view:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>View by Tree. The text you enter is matched against both the names of
		the commands and any assigned shortcut.</li>
		
		<li>View by Name. The text you enter is matched against only the names of the
		commands.</li>
		
		<li>View by Key. The key or key combination you press is matched only against
		the shortcuts.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h4>Changing a shortcut</h4>
	
	<p>To set a shortcut:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>In the tree view or list, select the command whose shortcut you
		want to change.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Tab</strong> to the short cut edit box,
		and press a key or key combination for the shortcut.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Tab</strong> to the Set button, and press it. If the shortcut
		is already assigned to another command, then an Error dialog opens which
		tells you the name of this command. If you press the OK button, then
		the shortcut will be set a requested, and removed from the other command.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>To clear a shortcut:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>In the Tree view or list, select the command whose shortcut
		you want to clear.</li>
		
		<li><strong>Tab</strong> to the Clear button, and press it.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<h3 id="standard-and-full">Standard and full sets of default shortcuts</h3>
	
	<p>There are two sets of default shortcuts:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>The full set includes all the shortcuts which were default shortcuts present in
		Audacity 2.1.3, and this guide assumes you are using the full set.</li>
		
		<li>The standard set, which is new in Audacity 2.2.0. This contains fewer shortcuts
		than the full set, the idea being to make it easier for people to set their
		own shortcuts, since there are fewer shortcuts that have already been assigned.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>If Audacity 2.2.0 is run in a user account where previous versions of Audacity have
	not been run, then Audacity users the standard set of shortcuts. However if a previous
	version has been run, then the full set if used, and there is no need to change which
	set of default shortcuts is being used.</p>
	
	<p>To reset all the shortcuts to either the standard or full set of defaults:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>In the Audacity Preferences dialog, select the Keyboard category.</li>
		
		<li>Tab to the Defaults button and press it. A menu opens.</li>
		
		<li>Choose Standard or Full</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<strong>Tab</strong> to the defaults button and press it. A menu opens, and
	choose either standard or full.
	
	
	
	<h3 id="the-and-shortcuts">The [ and ] shortcuts on keyboards other than US, UK or Irish</h3>
	
	<p>By default, the keyboard shortcuts for moving the cursor to the playback position
	and setting the end of the selection to be the playback position are [ and ].
	These shortcuts can also be used to open dialog boxes when there is no playback.</p>
	
	<p>On US, UK, and Irish keyboards, you can type [ and ] using the [ and ] keys,
	which are the two keys to the right of the P key. On nearly all the keyboards
	used in other countries, the keys used to type [ and ] are in different positions,
	and you often have to use modifier keys, such as <strong>Ctrl + Alt</strong>
	to type these characters. Unfortunately, using Audacity's default settings,
	[ and ] only work as the shortcuts when there are [ and ] keys to the right
	of the P key.</p>
	
	<p>Fortunately, there is a straightforward solution to this problem. All you
	need to do is set the keyboard shortcuts for the two commands using the
	method described in the previous section. The letters G and H are currently
	not used as the shortcuts for any commands, so a suitable option is to set the shortcut for
	the Left at Playback Position command to be the letter G, and the shortcut
	for the Right at Playback Position command to be the letter H.</p>
	
	<p>Note that you could set the shortcuts to be [ and ], but they often
	involve modifier keys and keys which aren't in very convenient positions.</p>  
	
	
	<h2 id="sound-dialog-in-windows">Sound dialog in Windows</h2>
	
	<p>The Windows sound dialog in Windows 7 and later versions has four pages:
	Playback, Recording, Sounds, and Communications.
	The following sections describe how to open this
	dialog, the controls on the Recording page, and how to open
	a device's properties dialog where you can adjust the input
	level of the device.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Opening the Sound dialog</h3>
	
	<p>Here are a couple of ways of opening the dialog, and moving
	to the Recording page. Method one:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Press <strong>Insert + F11</strong> to open the Select a
		System Tray Icon dialog.</li>
		
		<li>Select speakers or headphones, whatever is appropriate. Then press <strong>Enter</strong>
		to press the default Right Single Click button, and a context menu opens.</li>
		
		<li>On this menu choose Recording devices, which has the access key R, and the Sound dialog opens
		on the Recording page.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Method two:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Press the <strong>Windows Key</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>Type sound, then if necessary press <strong>Down Arrow</strong> until you get
		to Sound in the list of search results, and then press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li>
		
		<li>The Sound dialog opens on the Playback page, so you then
		have to move to the Recording page.</li>
	</ol>
	
	
	<h3>Recording page</h3>
	
	<p>The recording page contains a list of devices, and when appropriate,
	one or more of the buttons: Configure, Set Default, and Properties.
	The commands provided by the buttons are also available on the
	context menus of the devices in the list, and it's normally easier
	to use these, rather than the buttons.</p>
	
	<p>There are two options which control which devices appear on the
	list, and they appear on the context menu of any of the items in
	the list. The two options are Show Disabled Devices and Show
	Disconnected Devices, and by default both options are not checked.
	If you can't find a device which you think should be there, it
	may be disabled, and so will show up if the Show Disabled Devices
	option is checked.</p>
	
	<p>For each item on the list there are three lines of text: its
	name, a short description, and its status, which can be working,
	disabled, or Not plugged in. Unfortunately, Jaws only reads the
	the first of these lines. If you need to read the other lines,
	then you can press <strong>Insert + Numpad Minus</strong> to
	route the Jaws cursor to the PC cursor, and then use
	<strong>Up Arrow</strong> and <strong>Down Arrow</strong>. To switch back
	to using the PC cursor, press <strong>Numpad Plus</strong> or
	<strong>Insert + Numpad Plus</strong>.
	One way of telling if a device is disabled without having to
	use the Jaws cursor, is to open its
	context menu: if there's an Enable item, then the device is
	obviously disabled.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Device properties dialog</h3>
	
	<p>To open the Properties dialog of a device which is selected in
	list on the Recording page, press
	<strong>Spacebar</strong>, or choose Properties from its context
	menu.</p>
	
	<p>The input volume (level) can be set on the Levels page of
	this dialog. For many devices there's a single slider, but
	a microphone may also have a microphone boost slider.</p>	
	

	<h2 id="keystrokes">Keystrokes</h2>
	
	<p>These are the keystrokes for the full set of default keystrokes,
	&ndash; some of these are not included in the standard set. For more information about
	these two sets of defaults and how to change which set you are using,
	see the
	<a href="#standard-and-full">Standard and full sets of default shortcuts section</a>,
